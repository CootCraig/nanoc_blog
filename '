dang it gold’s supposed to go up! (report 4 december, 2016)
Monetary Metals's picture
by Monetary Metals 

The Treasury bond is payabl only in US dollars. The US dollar, which is
the liability of the Federal Reserve, is backed on by Treasurys. It’s
a nice little check-kiting scheme. But besides that, the two instruments
have the same risks. If you don’t like the bond, then you won’t like
the dollar either. The day will come when en masse, the market decides it
doesn’t like both of them, and gold will be the only acceptable money.

With due respect to our old friend Aragorn, today is not that day!

We believe interest rates are headed lower, not higher. But that said,
we do not see any particular causal relationship between the interest
rate and the price of gold. The former is the spread between the Fed’s
undefined asset and its undefined liability. It is unhinged and while
it could shoot the moon from Truman through Carter, it’s sailing in
the other direction now. Down to Hell.

The price of gold is the exchange rate between the Fed’s liability and
metal. So long as people strive to get more dollars—most especially
including those who bet on the price of gold, and those who write letters
encouraging the bettors—there is no reason for this exchange rate
to explode.

Again, to plagiarize the Ranger from the North, the day will come when
gold goes into permanent backwardation. But today is not that day!

Today (Friday’s close), the price of gold is down seven Federal Reserve
Notes from where it was a week ago.

So where to from here? Are those dratted fundamentals moving?

Hi Tim,

If I remember correctly, Thorsten and others were recommending
attaching foam to the back of the wizzers on pro speakers like the
Eminence. Actually, I have a few full range and WR vintage speakers,
including Norelco (Philips), Chrysler, Mitsubishi (Diatone) and
others. They did not get much respect here, particularly the Japanese
stuff, so I usually only paid a few dollars for them. While not the
P-610 that everyone wants, it is extremely similar and also is Alnico
Magnet. It sounds quite good with its matching cone tweeter in an
extremely thin, crappy looking cabinet. These Japanese speakers still
show up in thrift stores for cheap, because the primarily came with
cheap, all-in-one stereo's that have long since died. A lot of them are
in Radio Shack and Lafayette cabinets, that were paired with inexpensive
electronics. You can also find them in Kenwood (Trio), Pioneer, Sansui,
and others cabinets. On this side of the pond, it would be wise for a
budget minded audiophile to take your advice, and go searching there
thrift stores. It won't cost much every if you get burned a few times.

The other thing that is still readily available cheap in thrift stores are
subwoofer from home theater systems. All you need is a tweeter. The Foster
FT17 is capable of the job. There is also lots of good vintage stuff.

  Party Like It’s 1999: The Stock Market Is A Propaganda Tool - Dave Kranzler
</h4>

December 8, 2016 

Dave Kranzler spent many years working in various Wall Street jobs. After
business school, he traded junk bonds for a large bank. He has an MBA from
the University of Chicago, with a concentration in accounting and finance,
and graduated Oberlin College with majors in Economics and English. Dave
has nearly thirty years of experience in studying, researching, analyzing
and investing in the financial markets. Currently he co-manages a precious
metals and mining stock investment fund in Denver and publishes the Mining
Stock and Short Seller Journals. Contact Dave at dkranzler62@gmail.com.

Thus, pushing the stock market a lot higher is a mechanism that can be
used to influence the public’s sentiment and willingness to spend. This
is critical after an election in which the political party controlling
Capitol Hill changes and – more important – during the holiday
shopping season.

Without question the U.S. economy is beginning to quickly crumble. If
you “peel away” the manipulative techniques applied to the
economic reporting it reveals that every segment of the economy is
now contracting. Even the factory orders report for October released
yesterday – which showed a 2.7% gain over September – is still down
2.3% YTD vs the same YTD period in 2015. Strip away the transportation
component and it’s down 2.7%.

Market intervention in this manner is an attempt to convince the public
that the economic system is healthy and will be even healthier in the
future. As such it’s another subtle propaganda tool – a perception
management device. If the Fed were step away from the market, the stock
market would rapidly re-price to reflect the true underlying economic
reality. In short, stocks would crash and concomitantly gold and silver
would soar.

The ONLY thing that can explain the move in the stock market since around
2:00 a.m. EST after the election is massive Fed stimulus in some form
– either direct cash injections done in a format that won’t show up
on the Fed’s balance sheet or a massive spike up in the availability
of short term credit lines made available to banks and extended to hedge
funds. There is no other explanation.

Today for example, the stock market is spiking higher AND bond prices
are higher/yields lower. This makes absolutely no sense and can only be
explained by official intervention of some sort.

Gold and silver will “sniff” this out and at some point I expect
to see gold begin to move a lot higher and the dollar sell-off
precipitously. I also expect that the Chinese are going to send their
response to Trump’s inimical overtures on Twitter by accelerating
their sale of U.S. Treasuries.

This will not end well.

Understanding Evil: From Globalism To Pizzagate
Thursday, 08 December 2016 07:05 - Brandon Smith -
H/T ZeroHedge

... The first and most important thing to understand is this — evil is
NOT simply a social or religious construct, it is an inherent element of
the human psyche. Carl Gustav Jung was one of the few psychologists in
history to dare write extensively on the issue of evil from a scientific
perspective as well as a metaphysical perspective.  I highly recommend
a book of his collected works on this subject titled 'Jung On Evil',
edited by Murray Stein, for those who are interested in a deeper view.

... The concepts of good and evil, moral and immoral, are present in us from
birth and are mostly the same regardless of where we are born, what time
in history we are born and to what culture we are born. Good and evil
are shared subjective experiences.  It is this observable psychological
fact (among others) that leads me to believe in the idea of a creative
design — a god.  Again, though, elaborating on god is beyond the scope
of this article.

  Cash Is No Longer King: The Phasing Out of Physical Money Has Begun
</h4>

If you want a glimpse of  how this story ends, all you have to do is look
at Venezuela, where the government has destroyed the value of the bolivar
(and U.S. intervention has further exacerbated the problem). Desperation
has overcome the country, leading women to go as far as selling their
own hair just to get by. While crime and murder rates have spiked
to all-time highs, the most dangerous threat to Venezuelans has been
extensive government planning. The money they work for and save is now
so valueless it’s weighed instead of counted. The stacks of bills have
to be carried around in backpacks, and the scene is reminiscent of the
hyperinflation Weimar Germany experienced in the 1920s. Few Western
nations have ever experienced a currency crisis before, meaning many
are blind to the inevitable consequences that come from the unending
stimulus we’ve seen since 2008.

In order to keep this kind of chaos from spreading like a contagion
to the rest of the world, representatives are willing to do anything
necessary, but this comes at a cost. Instead of having to worry about
carrying around wheelbarrows full of money, the fear in a cashless
society will likely stem from bank customers’ restricted access to
funds. With no physical way for consumers to take possession of their
wealth, the banking interests will decide how much is available.

The level of trust most people still have in the current system
is astonishing. Even after decades of incompetence, manipulation,
and irresponsibility, the public still grasps to government and the
established order like a child learning how to swim. The responsibility
that comes with independence has intimidated the entire population into
leaving the decisions up to so-called  ‘experts.’ It just so happens
that those trusted policymakers have an agenda to strip you and future
generations of prosperity.

Some of the few hopes in this war against centralization are peer-to-peer
technologies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These innovative platforms have
the potential to open up markets that circumvent state-controlled Ponzi
schemes. The future development of crypto-assets has massive potential,
but being co-opted is a real danger.

The greatest threat to individual freedom is financial dependence, and
as long as your wealth is under someone else’s control, it can never
be completely secure. Unfortunately, private blockchains are becoming
increasingly popular, creating trojan horses for those just learning about
the technology (in contrast, Bitcoin’s transaction ledger is public)
. Without the decentralized aspect of a financial network, it is just
a giant tracking database that can be easily compromised like any other.
