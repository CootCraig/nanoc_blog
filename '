### Background

In 1986, as the U.S. Mint began issuing gold coins for the first time
since 1933, a tax rule against holding "collectibles" in an IRA was
relaxed to allow gold and silver Eagles. Later, in 1997, the Tax Payer
Relief Act opened the IRA door for a broad spectrum of precious metals
(gold, silver, platinum, and palladium), whether in the form of bullion
or coin. The easier rules now apply to all types of IRAs, including
traditional, Roth, Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) and Simplified
Incentive Match Plans for Employees (SIMPLE).

The only stipulation is that all bars and all coins other than Eagles
must be .995 fine. Thus Canadian Maple Leafs and Austrian Philharmonics
qualify, but the South African Krugerrand, minted with an alloy, does
not. Numismatic coins are also impermissible for an IRA.

### Mechanics

The procedure for putting gold into an IRA is somewhat more complicated
than with paper assets, but the requirements aren’t onerous.

To begin with, you have to find an IRA custodian that handles investments
in metals, and they are few. Don’t look to your discount broker or a
fund family like Vanguard; they won’t touch the stuff. Instead, you’ll
need a specialist like the two original gold IRA custodial companies,
American Church Trust (acquired by GoldStar Trust in 2007) and Sterling
Trust. These are the most respected names in the business. An Internet
search will turn up others, and if you do your due diligence on them,
you might find one that works for you.

But remember that it’s especially important to choose a custodian with
a solid reputation, because your gold will be stored at a location twice
removed from you. A firm such as GoldStar or Sterling would be merely
your IRA’s legal custodian; for vaulting your IRA gold, it will employ
a certified depository, likely either HSBC Bank USA (which is also a
COMEX gold depository) or Delaware Depository Services.

So chances are you’ll have to open a separate IRA for physical gold,
which will be a matter of doing a little paperwork and paying some
fees. Then you put money into your account and tell the custodian what
to buy. (Dropping in coins you already own is against the rules - a
"prohibited transaction".) And if you want to mix in some paper - for
example, to consolidate your gold, ETF, and mining stock holdings into
one account - that’s fine, too.

The custodian will charge either a fixed annual fee or a percentage of the
IRA’s value, with a ceiling. And the depository will charge its own fee
for safekeeping. There also may be a transaction fee each time you add to
your IRA. In all, you can expect the basic cost to run between $160 and
$340 per year, depending on the fee structure of the custodian you choose.

You can make the same tax-deductible contribution each year to a gold
IRA as with any other IRA. The current limit is $5,000, or a "catch-up"
limit of $6,000 for those 50 and over. Custodians generally set their
minimum initial investment at that $5,000 mark but will accept smaller
subsequent contributions.

When the time comes to withdraw from your gold IRA, you don’t get any
coins or bars, alas. You get cash. The custodian sells the gold and
distributes the proceeds, with the money then taxed at your ordinary
income rate, just as with any other asset held in an IRA.

### Who Should Consider It

That takes care of the how-to. The trickier part is whether it’s a
good idea.

There are some situations when an IRA may be the right place to hold
part or all of your investment in physical gold....

No-income portfolio. If you’ve decided that the outlook for bonds and
dividend-paying stocks is so bleak that you don’t want any at all,
then putting gold into your IRA won’t crowd out any income-earning
investments.

Strategic switching. Perhaps you plan at some point, when you judge that
the gold bull market probably has run its course, to liquidate part
of your gold. Whatever gold you have in an IRA then could be sold and
reinvested, with no loss to current tax, in something else.

IRA Only. If your IRA is the only investment vehicle you have, and you
want gold, then using funds within the IRA to buy gold may be the only
way for you to hold it.

For many other readers, holding in gold in an IRA is not be a good
idea. Here’s why.

The idea behind a traditional IRA is twofold. First, reduce present
taxes by taking a deduction upfront for your yearly contribution of
$5K or $6K. Second, defer taxes on the investment income and gains that
build up inside the IRA until after retirement.

Physical gold, of course, doesn’t generate income. So you might be
wasting part of your IRA’s tax-saving power by filling it with gold
instead of investments that earn interest, dividends, or trading profits.

### Transfers and Rollovers

In researching this topic, we chatted with Glen Kirsch of Asset Strategies
International, who has been dealing with gold and gold-related investments
for more than thirty years. We asked Glen what would be the benefit of a
gold IRA. His experience accords with our analysis of when putting gold
in an IRA makes sense.

He said he rarely if ever sees people open a gold IRA just to deposit that
five grand a year. What he does see is individuals making the flight to
quality with their accumulated retirement assets. Say, someone with most
of his wealth in a pension fund limited by a menu of poor investments
is searching for a way out. If the individual is generally suspicious
of paper investments, a gold IRA will look attractive.

Making the move is simple if the pension fund is already an IRA. You’re
free to transfer funds from an IRA that’s invested in stocks or anything
else directly into a gold IRA.

Or if the pension fund is run by your employer, when you leave (quit,
retire, or get fired), you can roll your interest in the pension fund
over into an IRA, without tax consequences, and use the money to buy gold.

Of course, holding physical gold - in your possession and under your
control - is Rule #1 in this crisis. Buying and holding it will protect
your assets, whether it’s in your IRA or stored somewhere else safe.
