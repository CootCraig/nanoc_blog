<h5>How to Remove Bindweed</h5>

Vigilance and persistence are the two most useful weapons in your arsenal
against bindweed. Watch for signs of this vine, and remove it as quickly
as possible. The best way to get rid of bindweed is to cut it off at
soil level. Don't bother pulling it up; it will just sprout wherever
you tore the roots--and it is virtually impossible to get all the roots
out. By continually cutting it off at ground level, and doing it as soon
as you possibly can, you will eventually starve the plant (since it will
be unable to photosynthesize), and it will die. Be patient! You may have
to do this many times, but it will eventually do the trick.
