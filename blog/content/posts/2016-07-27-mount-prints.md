Once you get to a 20x30 it's a two man job

(regarding Peter Lik)
According to several of his sales staff including one who claimed is his
lead trainer, he has switched from Lexan to acrylic. He uses FujiFlex,
which is one of several "fuji crystal archive" paper, although technically
it's not a paper, but rather a polyester based product.  The result is
a mirror smooth surface which is ideal for face mounting.

I'm more concerned with the sudden move to aluminum, which has most of
the visual qualities of face mounted prints but is more durable and very
scratch resistant. However the testing shows me the magenta dyes will fade
faster than others meaning the print will gradually turn green over time.
I'd love to see Aardenburg test an aluminum print like this, because if it
lasts as well as face mounted acrylic it's something I'd look into making.
