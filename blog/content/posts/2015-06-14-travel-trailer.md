* Excellent product - Love it!!!
* ByR. Lingleon December 30, 2014

This is by far, the best hitch I've ever owned, seems very well built,
looks and works great on my lifted Jeep. However I have to say that when
I first got it installed, I hated it. As stated in other reviews, it
seemed very loose in the receiver and while I did not tow anything with
it while loose like this, it seems it would have to make some racket,
particularly for heavier trailers. To give it credit though, I measured
the outside dimensions against other hitches I had laying around -
it is the exact same size. So how did I go from hate to love? I added
a couple of things - 1st, a 2 inch Hitch Clamp Heavy Duty from Amazon -
a one bolt design, easy to install or remove and now the hitch does not
move at all - acts as though it's welded to the truck. Then I bought
two of the Trimax T-3BLACK Premium 5/8" Key Receiver Locks and used one
to secure it to the Jeep and the 2nd one on the adjustable arm. Another
option on the arm movement would be to use at least one 5/8 x 3 1/2 bolt
and lock nut however I tow different trailers and wanted a faster option
to change the height.

I'm a stickler for design, durability and ease of use and thus I do a
lot of research before I purchase anything. I really like the design of
this unit, particularly the weld points, extra steel plate on top corner
and really thick powder coating. So while I did spend some additional
cash for the clamp hitch tightener and locks, I'm VERY happy with the
unit and I highly recommend the product.

The Telescopic Type is the most popular because it requires no existing trailer frame crossmember for installation. The unit will telescope to fit any underbody frame width. The "T" Type Stabilizing Jacks require an existing trailer frame crossmember and are mounted individually.

    2000 lbs. static load per individual jack.
    Easy to install, either bolts or welds to trailer frame.
    Works equally well hitched or unhitched.
    Durable tool quality speed wrench for easy operation.

FWIW: That information is 5 years old and some of the items mentioned
may no longer be available.

The current weapon of choice is the Progressive Dynamics PD-4045 power
center that includes AC distribution, a converter, 12 fuse stations,
and a three stage smart charger for the battery.

I have installed more than six of these without problems. Usually less
