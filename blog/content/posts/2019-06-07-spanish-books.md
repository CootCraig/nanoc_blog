  Marianela by Benito Pérez Galdós in 1878.
</h3>

Marianela is a Spanish novel written by Benito Pérez Galdós in 1878.
Several secondary characters appear in the novella that would become
protagonists in his later novel cycle, Novelas españolas contemporáneas
(Contemporary Spanish Novels).

In 1940, 1955 and 1972, the novel was adapted into films. A Mexican TV
series based on the novel was filmed in 1961. In 1988 there was a second
Mexican adaptation of Marianela as soap opera Flor y Canela starring
Edith Gonzalez (Florentina), Ernesto Laguardia (Pablo) and Daniela Leites
(Marianela). There is also a teleteatro of Marianela starring Fernando
Colunga as Pablo.

</h3>

<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

The very acute and lively Spanish critic who signs himself Clarin, and
is known personally as Don Leopoldo Alas, says the present Spanish novel
has no yesterday, but only a day-before-yesterday. It does not derive
from the romantic novel which immediately preceded that: the novel,
large or little, as it was with Cervantes, Hurtado de Mendoza, Quevedo,
and the masters of picaresque fiction.

Clarin dates its renascence from the political revolution of 1868,
which gave Spanish literature the freedom necessary to the fiction that
studies to reflect modern life, actual ideas, and current aspirations; and
though its authors were few at first, “they have never been adventurous
spirits, friends of Utopia, revolutionists, or impatient progressists and
reformers.” He thinks that the most daring, the most advanced, of the
new Spanish novelists, and the best by far, is Don Benito Perez Galdos.

I should myself have made my little exception in favor of Don Armando
Palacio Valdes, but Clarin speaks with infinitely more authority, and I
am certainly ready to submit when he goes on to say that Galdos is not
a social or literary insurgent; that he has no political or religious
prejudices; that he shuns extremes, and is charmed with prudence; that his
novels do not attack the Catholic dogmas—though they deal so severely
with Catholic bigotry—but the customs and ideas cherished by secular
fanaticism to the injury of the Church. Because this is so evident,
our critic holds, his novels are “found in the bosom of families in
every corner of Spain.” Their popularity among all classes in Catholic
and prejudiced Spain, and not among free-thinking students merely,
bears testimony to the fact that his aim and motive are understood and
appreciated, although his stories are apparently so often anti-Catholic.
