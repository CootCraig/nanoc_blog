# Spa decontamination by "Hillbilly Hot Tub"

<a href="http://www.poolspaforum.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=13119&p=61564" target="_blank">Decontamination steps.</a>


### Decontamination steps.

1. Filters: Remove the filter(s) and either clean or replace it. To clean the filter first use a filter cleaner per label directions. After rinsing the cartridge, completely submerge it in a 1/10 dilution of liquid bleach from 1-4 hours. Inspect and clean the filter housing interior. Install the filters after spa decontamination is complete.
2. Raise the water level in the spa to 1/2 inch above the high water mark.
3. Add at least 100 ppm chlorine to the spa.
4. cover the spa.
5 circulate the water at the maximum rate for at least 30-45 minutes. Make sure all jets aor open and on high.
6. While the water is circulating, turn the blower , if equiped, on and off every 5 minutes. If you have air to the jets turn the air adjustments off and on every 5 minutes.
7. Stop the circulation by turning jets off.
8. While spa is draining rinse the sides several times.
9. Clean the spa with a surface cleaner and rinse off to remove the cleaner.
10. Drain spa to remove any excess water and cleaner
I would add to this that the pillows,cover, under the edges of the control knobs shouls also be wiped with bleach water. I would through the pillows right into the tub while it is decontaminating.
11. Refill spa with water, replace the filter with a new or cleaned filter.
12. Balance the water.
13. To verify decontamination, shock treat the spa with 10 ppm of chlorine. Allow the spa to circulate for 8-12 hours and check sanitizer level in the spa. If there is no free chlorine, excessive demand still exsists, repeat the decontamination procedure.
14. If free chlorine still exsists proceed with routine maintenance of the spa.
15. If after 2 successive attempts to decontaminate the spa, evidence of contamination persists, a serious problem may exist. Do not resume spa use, contact a professional to resolve.

### Summary

#### Water Balance

* If your CH is much below 100 ppm, raise it to ~150 ppm. Otherwise, make a note of it.
* Adjust your TA to ~50 ppm. Use Baking Soda to raise it (unlikely to be needed), or Acid/Aeration method to lower it. It takes ~8 oz Dry Acid to lower TA by 100 ppm in a 350 Gal Tub. Don't add all at once!
* pH should be between 7.2-7.8. Aerate to Raise pH. Acid to lower it.
* If pH creeps up too much (>8.0), lower TA. If pH is to low, and doesn't raise enough by aeration, raise TA.  Add ~50 ppm Borate. (Borox/Acid or Gentle Spa)
* Calcium, Baking Soda, Dry Acid and Borates is all you need to balance your water.
* Use PoolMath to calculate exact amounts to add.

#### Sanitation

* On a fresh fill use Dichlor until you get to 20-30 ppm CYA. (10 ppm FC = 9 ppm CYA)
* Then switch to Clorox Unscented 6% bleach.
* Never let FC drop to Zero for any length of time. Keep it between 3-6 ppm normally, min of 1 ppm, and shock to 12 ppm once a week.
* Use MPS if needed before hot tub party's and/or once a week to help oxidation. Don't use more than needed, because it's acidic and may lower your TA/pH.
* Dichlor, Bleach and MPS is all you need to keep your tub sanitized.
* Use PoolMath to calculate exact amounts to add.

Lastly, get a drop test kit such as the Taylor K-2006.

Also get FC test strips. They come in handy for a quick FC estimate,
during party's etc.

The only two things you need to check regularly are FC and pH. Check
them everyday and after soaks.

Adjust TA as needed. If you have your water well balanced, you'll rarely
need to adjust your TA.

You'll just be adding chlorine everyday, and after soaks.

Shock once a week, and/or after high bather loads. Use MPS if you have
party's, and/or don't want to use as much chlorine.

Easy as can be, and your tub is always ready.

<a href="http://www.troublefreepool.com/threads/87486-Hot-tub-arrived-water-chemistry-questions?p=749741&viewfull=1#post749741" target="_blank">chem geek - Re: Hot tub arrived, water chemistry questions</a>

Well, you really didn't want to get your TA up to the 80-120 ppm range if
you planned on using the Dichlor-then-bleach method or any other method
that avoided CYA or CH buildup. Leisure Time Spa 56 is Dichlor. The UV
won't help very much unless you kept your chlorine level high during
a soak in which case the UV might help control chloramines somewhat so
reduce their smell. Otherwise, the UV will just use up chlorine faster
(ozone does that as well though in heavy bather load spas it oxidizes
bather waste). Leisure Time Replenish is a combination of Dichlor and
non-chlorine shock (MPS). By weight it's around 15% Dichlor and 31% MPS
(72% of the Oxone triple salt -- they incorrectly say on the label this
is potassium monopersulfate but only part of it is that chemical) and 13%
Other ingredients (possibly an unspecified clarifier).

You need to decide how you are going to manage your spa. At this point,
you've been following what the spa store tells you to do. You're on your
own in that case. If you want to follow TFP practices, then read the Pool
School article Using Chlorine in Your Spa. The ProClear cartridge is 0.92%
metallic silver (from silver nitrate) so competes with Nature2. You
need to decide whether you want to have a chlorine spa such as using
the Dichlor-then-bleach method described in the Pool School article or
whether you want to try mostly non-chlorine where you primarily depend
on the silver ions and MPS for disinfection and most oxidation. Just
note that unlike Nature2, ProClear did not go through EPA approval. When
using primarily MPS, one usually needs to use chlorine every week or so
to keep the water clear since MPS doesn't oxidize all the bather waste.

With either technique (chlorine or MPS) the rough rule-of-thumb is that
every person-hour of soaking in a hot (104ºF) spa requires around 3-1/2
teaspoons of Dichlor or 3-1/2 fluid ounces of 8.25% bleach or 7 teaspoons
of 43% MPS non-chlorine shock. The real rule is to add whatever amount
is needed after a soak so that you still have a measurable residual
for the start of your next soak. Usually people start their soak with
around 1-2 ppm FC to minimize odor and then add chlorine or MPS right
after their soak.

The Dichlor-then-bleach method is the least expensive and easiest to
measure method. Does your spa have an ozonator? How often do you plan
to use the spa? The main downside with chlorine methods is that ozone
reacts with chlorine so if you don't use the spa every day or two, then
the ozonator uses up chlorine so quickly that you have to add chlorine
every day or two. With no ozonator, you can probably just add chlorine
once mid-week if you only soak on weekends (you might be able to shock it
higher after a soak and have it last the week if the water temperature
is allowed to drop, but again only if there is no ozonator). Your UV
system may act somewhat like an ozonator in that it may increase chlorine
demand. If you aren't soaking frequently, you may consider disconnecting
it (or may just do that anyway regardless).

You refer to your own testing with Total Hardness which includes magnesium
since that is what test strips are mostly limited to testing. As you
can tell, it's probably wrong. Once you get your K-2006 you can get the
CH to 150 ppm to reduce foaming though I suspect your CH might already
be that high or higher given your well water. You will want to lower
your TA at some point though initially when using Dichlor you may be
OK if you find your pH not rising too fast. You'll want to order the
boric acid to get 50 ppm borates and can do so from DudaDiesel or The
Chemistry Store. You'll add that just before switching from Dichlor to
bleach and after you've gotten your TA down to 50 ppm.


<a href="http://www.troublefreepool.com/threads/72024-Fresh-Fill-Now-What" target="_blank">TikiTime - Fresh Fill - Now What</a>

### bridgeman

If you're using dichlor then bleach the CYA won't come up immediately,
so focus on getting the right FC level and keep track of the amount of
dichlor you add, then switch to bleach when you've added that amount.

30 ppm of CYA is a good number, and also happens to be the lowest level
my test kit can reliably read. I ran with 20 ppm CYA until I got a good
test kit, then I raised it to 30 so the test kit could measure it. There's
probably something fundamentally wrong with that but I can live with it

There's an "Effects of adding chemicals" section near the bottom you
can use to figure out the total amount of dichlor required to reach your
target CYA level, although you have to do it via the "trial and error"
approach (hint - try 3 oz of dichlor). For my tub (which is larger than
yours) a *total* of 6 oz of dichlor is enough to take CYA just past 30
ppm, so I dose with dichlor according to what PoolMath tells me until
I get to a total of 6 oz, then switch to dosing with bleach.

Note that the target FC range per PoolMath is 1-3 ppm when you have 0
CYA (fresh fill) and 2-6 ppm when you have 30 ppm CYA (where I switch to
bleach). In a perfect world you would ramp up your target FC as you get
closer to the target CYA level, but you could probably keep your target
at 3 until you reach 30ppm CYA and then set your target to 6. By target
I mean the FC level you dose up to, with the idea being that it will be
lower but still in range when you test the next day.

I have only run through the exercise once (twice if you count discovering
the dichlor/bleach method after running the tub on dichlor-only for
a while) -- the water has been so nice and clean I haven't bothered
changing it for a few months now.

### chem geek

Yeah, that 7 ppm FC is PER 350 GALLONS. It would only be 3.5 ppm FC
in 700 gallons. The amount of chlorine is absolute per person-hour of
soaking. The FC level corresponding to that will vary depending on the
spa size. The typical spa store recommendations of adding some fixed
amount after a soak are on the right track and they usually say it's
an amount per person, but they don't usually say anything about it also
being proportional to how long you soak.

Then there are subtleties such as water temperature (one sweats more
at higher temperature) and whether one has an ozonator. Ozone oxidizes
both bather waste as well as chlorine so in high bather-load situations
ozone reduces the amount of chlorine you need but in low bather-load
situations (i.e. days of no use in between soaks) it increases the amount
of (background dose) chlorine you need.

### chem geek

Since I don't know what specific other chemicals you are using, it's
hard to say. Some systems use a phosphate pH buffer and that will
certainly precipitate calcium (as calcium phosphate). If you go with
Dichlor-then-bleach, I target 50 ppm for the TA and use 50 ppm Borates
as well. Other than that, everything else is described correctly in
Using Chlorine in a Spa.

# ProTeam GentleSpa

### Nitro at TFP - How do I use Chlorine in my Spa (or pool)? 

Lastly, there is one more thing I haven't mentioned that you can add
to your tub that will help buffer your pH, Borates. The easiest way to
add Borates to your tub is to get a product called Gentle Spa. It is pH
balanced, so there is no need to add acid to counter balance it. The
ideal amount is ~50 ppm, and only needs to be added once per water
change. That will help keep your pH from drifting from aeration. Not to
mention, actually make your water feel silkier. I highly recommend it.
