## Good TA

SO, what's a good TA then? Because spas tends to have a lot of aeration
from jets and because the water is hot, it is best to keep the TA low
at around 50 ppm.

OK, how do we adjust TA then? If TA is too low, you just add Baking Soda
to raise it. However, if TA is high, it's little more involved. You'll
need Acid (Dry or Muriatic). Depending on how high your TA is will depend
on how long it will take you. Plan on it taking around an hour to decrease
TA by 100 ppm. So if your TA is 300 ppm, plan it taking around 2-3
hours. First, uncover your tub and turn on all your jets, air, blowers,
waterfalls etc. Test your pH. When it's greater than 7.8, add enough
acid to bring it down to 7.0. Keep aerating until your pH is 7.8 again
(about 30 min), then add more acid and repeat. Every time you add acid
you're lowering your pH and TA. When you get your TA tuned perfectly,
your pH will rise to a level (i.e. ~7.6) and stop, then you know you're at
your ideal TA level. If your pH is rising too high (>8.0), bring your TA
down a little more. If your pH doesn't rise enough from aeration (after
an hour or more), you over shot it and need to add a little Baking Soda
to raise your TA. After a few days/weeks of monitoring it, you'll get
your TA tuned perfectly. You may need to add a little Dry Acid once a
week or two, but your water should be well balanced at that point.

I wouldn't go much below 50 ppm TA, because that could become unstable if
you add any kind of acid. Also, if you have a very high TA, above 100, you
may need to add more acid in the beginning to get your pH down. Remember,
TA is a pH buffer, so the higher the TA, the more acid you need to bring
the pH down. It takes approximately 8 oz total of Dry Acid to bring TA
down 100 ppm in a 350 Gal tub. However, the key is not to add too much
acid all at once to bring your pH down under 7.0. That's why you should
aerate in between adding acid.

### Add Boric Acid

Borates target is 50

PoolMath 320 gal. spa. 0-50. 12 oz by weight

## Chlorine Sanitation

### First Dichlor

Add 0.3 oz Dichlor
PoolMath says 0-3.9 FC

Use Dichlor until 2.1 oz has been added. (25 ppm CYA)

# More Research

~~~~~~~~~~~~
Use Dichlor until 2.1 oz has been added.
~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~
Adding 10 ppm of Dichlor == 9 ppm CYA
Target CYA of 20-30 ppm.
0.85 oz of Dichor adds 10 ppm CYA
2.5 oz of Dichlor adds 29 ppm CYA
2.1 oz of Dichlor addes 25 ppm CYA
~~~~~~~~~~~~

So, I'm going to assume our target CYA is 30, but feel free to use 20
and adjust as necessary. I find that it's easier to keep track of how
much Dichlor you're adding to the tub and calculate the CYA, rather than
testing CYA with the drop test kit until you get a 30 ppm reading. For
every 10 ppm of Dichlor you add to your tub, you add 9 ppm CYA. So roughly
34 ppm Dichlor will give you 30 CYA. On a fresh fill, and after your water
is balanced by the above method, shock your tub with Dichlor to 10 ppm
FC. Then over the course of the next days, depending on bather load,
add 24 ppm more FC using Dichlor. You want to keep your FC normally
between 3-6 ppm everyday. This means you will be testing your FC EVERYDAY.

As for how much oxidizer to add after each soak, the rough rule-of-thumb
with no ozonator and a hot (104ºF) spa is that every person-hour requires
3-1/2 teaspoons of Dichlor or 3-1/2 fluid ounces of 8.25% bleach or 7
teaspoons of non-chlorine shock (43% MPS) to oxidize bather waste. The
real rule is to add whatever you need to so that you still have roughly
2-5 ppm chlorine for the start of your next soak

#### How

(granules are recommended)

We recommend maintaining borates at between 30 and 50 ppm. That normally
means raising the borate level to around 50 each spring, so that it will
still be above 30 come fall.

Before you start on borates, adjust your TA level towards the low end
of the appropriate range for your situation. See the Recommended Levels
chart for appropriate levels. It is easier to adjust TA before adding
borates than it will be after.

There are two approaches to adding borates to the pool: boric acid, or a
combination of Borax and muriatic acid. Using boric acid is just slightly
more expensive in most cases, and way easier. Borax and muriatic acid
takes more effort and handling that much acid is just slightly dangerous,
but saves just a little money (if you shop carefully).

In either case you can use PoolMath to calculate the quantities required.

#### JoyfulNoise - Re: Borates - Why and How 

Borates in my pool water has been a net positive for me. Better pH control
(let's me run my TA on the low side) and I got a little efficiency boost
in sanitizing as the SWG could run a little easier. Not everyone gets
positive results so I hope it works out for you (another reason possibly
not to buy so much up front).

Re: Borate formula using ProTeam Gentle Spa 

Gentle Spa is not as pH neutral as they claim and people who have used
it report that it raises the pH a lot, but not as much as just being
borax. Instead of using this product which is more expensive anyway,
just get boric acid directly from DudaDiesel, AAA Chemicals (better for
pool sized applications since they don't sell smaller quantities), or The
Chemistry Store. With boric acid you don't need to do much pH balancing
as it is only slightly acidic (moves the pH from 7.5 to 7.2 typically).

Forget the part about maintenance. That's just bunk except for the
very small amount of water dilution that occurs from carry-out and
refill. Evaporation and refill doesn't change the concentration and the
borates don't degrade.

Re: How to clean a cartridge filter

First, find the amount of displaced water when adding a cartridge.

* Fill a vessel such as a clean garbage can with enough water to cover a cartridge. 
* Measure the volume.
* Mark the water level.
* Add a cartridge. Agitate it to knock off and trapped air.
* The water level will have risen some. Siphon off the water into a large corn pot until you get the water level back to the original mark.
* Measure the amount of water in the corn pot. That is how much water is displaced by a single cartridge. Adding additional cartridges should displace the same amount.

Now you can calculate how many gallons and how much TSP.

# Spa decontamination by "Hillbilly Hot Tub"

<a href="http://www.poolspaforum.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=13119&p=61564" target="_blank">Decontamination steps.</a>


### Decontamination steps.

1. Filters: Remove the filter(s) and either clean or replace it. To clean the filter first use a filter cleaner per label directions. After rinsing the cartridge, completely submerge it in a 1/10 dilution of liquid bleach from 1-4 hours. Inspect and clean the filter housing interior. Install the filters after spa decontamination is complete.
2. Raise the water level in the spa to 1/2 inch above the high water mark.
3. Add at least 100 ppm chlorine to the spa.
4. cover the spa.
5 circulate the water at the maximum rate for at least 30-45 minutes. Make sure all jets aor open and on high.
6. While the water is circulating, turn the blower , if equiped, on and off every 5 minutes. If you have air to the jets turn the air adjustments off and on every 5 minutes.
7. Stop the circulation by turning jets off.
8. While spa is draining rinse the sides several times.
9. Clean the spa with a surface cleaner and rinse off to remove the cleaner.
10. Drain spa to remove any excess water and cleaner
I would add to this that the pillows,cover, under the edges of the control knobs shouls also be wiped with bleach water. I would through the pillows right into the tub while it is decontaminating.
11. Refill spa with water, replace the filter with a new or cleaned filter.
12. Balance the water.
13. To verify decontamination, shock treat the spa with 10 ppm of chlorine. Allow the spa to circulate for 8-12 hours and check sanitizer level in the spa. If there is no free chlorine, excessive demand still exsists, repeat the decontamination procedure.
14. If free chlorine still exsists proceed with routine maintenance of the spa.
15. If after 2 successive attempts to decontaminate the spa, evidence of contamination persists, a serious problem may exist. Do not resume spa use, contact a professional to resolve.

### Summary

#### Water Balance

* If your CH is much below 100 ppm, raise it to ~150 ppm. Otherwise, make a note of it.
* Adjust your TA to ~50 ppm. Use Baking Soda to raise it (unlikely to be needed), or Acid/Aeration method to lower it. It takes ~8 oz Dry Acid to lower TA by 100 ppm in a 350 Gal Tub. Don't add all at once!
* pH should be between 7.2-7.8. Aerate to Raise pH. Acid to lower it.
* If pH creeps up too much (>8.0), lower TA. If pH is to low, and doesn't raise enough by aeration, raise TA.  Add ~50 ppm Borate. (Borox/Acid or Gentle Spa)
* Calcium, Baking Soda, Dry Acid and Borates is all you need to balance your water.
* Use PoolMath to calculate exact amounts to add.

#### Sanitation

* On a fresh fill use Dichlor until you get to 20-30 ppm CYA. (10 ppm FC = 9 ppm CYA)
* Then switch to Clorox Unscented 6% bleach.
* Never let FC drop to Zero for any length of time. Keep it between 3-6 ppm normally, min of 1 ppm, and shock to 12 ppm once a week.
* Use MPS if needed before hot tub party's and/or once a week to help oxidation. Don't use more than needed, because it's acidic and may lower your TA/pH.
* Dichlor, Bleach and MPS is all you need to keep your tub sanitized.
* Use PoolMath to calculate exact amounts to add.

Lastly, get a drop test kit such as the Taylor K-2006.

Also get FC test strips. They come in handy for a quick FC estimate,
during party's etc.

The only two things you need to check regularly are FC and pH. Check
them everyday and after soaks.

Adjust TA as needed. If you have your water well balanced, you'll rarely
need to adjust your TA.

You'll just be adding chlorine everyday, and after soaks.

Shock once a week, and/or after high bather loads. Use MPS if you have
party's, and/or don't want to use as much chlorine.

Easy as can be, and your tub is always ready.

<a href="http://www.troublefreepool.com/content/123-abc-of-pool-water-chemistry" target="_blank">TFPC - ABCs of Pool Water Chemistry</a>

There are five chemical levels that every pool owner needs to keep
track of:

* FC - Free Chlorine - A sanitizer which keeps your pool water safe and free of germs. Chlorine must be constantly replenished. (level depends on CYA)
* PH - Acidity/Alkalinity - Needs to be kept in balance to prevent irritation and protect the pool equipment. (7.5 to 7.8)
* TA - Total Alkalinity - Appropriate levels help keep the PH in balance. High levels can cause PH to rise. (60 to 120, sometimes higher)
* CH - Calcium Hardness - Appropriate levels help prevent plaster damage. High levels can cause calcium scaling. (220 to 350, vinyl lower)
* CYA - Cyanuric Acid - Protects chlorine from sunlight and determines the required FC level. (outdoors 30 to 50, SWG 70 to 80, indoors 0 to 20) 

And others

* CC - Combined Chlorine - CC over 0.5 indicates a problem.
* Borate - An optional enhancement.

Well, you really didn't want to get your TA up to the 80-120 ppm range if
you planned on using the Dichlor-then-bleach method or any other method
that avoided CYA or CH buildup. Leisure Time Spa 56 is Dichlor. The UV
won't help very much unless you kept your chlorine level high during
a soak in which case the UV might help control chloramines somewhat so
reduce their smell. Otherwise, the UV will just use up chlorine faster
(ozone does that as well though in heavy bather load spas it oxidizes
bather waste). Leisure Time Replenish is a combination of Dichlor and
non-chlorine shock (MPS). By weight it's around 15% Dichlor and 31% MPS
(72% of the Oxone triple salt -- they incorrectly say on the label this
is potassium monopersulfate but only part of it is that chemical) and 13%
Other ingredients (possibly an unspecified clarifier).

You need to decide how you are going to manage your spa. At this point,
you've been following what the spa store tells you to do. You're on your
own in that case. If you want to follow TFP practices, then read the Pool
School article Using Chlorine in Your Spa. The ProClear cartridge is 0.92%
metallic silver (from silver nitrate) so competes with Nature2. You
need to decide whether you want to have a chlorine spa such as using
the Dichlor-then-bleach method described in the Pool School article or
whether you want to try mostly non-chlorine where you primarily depend
on the silver ions and MPS for disinfection and most oxidation. Just
note that unlike Nature2, ProClear did not go through EPA approval. When
using primarily MPS, one usually needs to use chlorine every week or so
to keep the water clear since MPS doesn't oxidize all the bather waste.

With either technique (chlorine or MPS) the rough rule-of-thumb is that
every person-hour of soaking in a hot (104ºF) spa requires around 3-1/2
teaspoons of Dichlor or 3-1/2 fluid ounces of 8.25% bleach or 7 teaspoons
of 43% MPS non-chlorine shock. The real rule is to add whatever amount
is needed after a soak so that you still have a measurable residual
for the start of your next soak. Usually people start their soak with
around 1-2 ppm FC to minimize odor and then add chlorine or MPS right
after their soak.

The Dichlor-then-bleach method is the least expensive and easiest to
measure method. Does your spa have an ozonator? How often do you plan
to use the spa? The main downside with chlorine methods is that ozone
reacts with chlorine so if you don't use the spa every day or two, then
the ozonator uses up chlorine so quickly that you have to add chlorine
every day or two. With no ozonator, you can probably just add chlorine
once mid-week if you only soak on weekends (you might be able to shock it
higher after a soak and have it last the week if the water temperature
is allowed to drop, but again only if there is no ozonator). Your UV
system may act somewhat like an ozonator in that it may increase chlorine
demand. If you aren't soaking frequently, you may consider disconnecting
it (or may just do that anyway regardless).

You refer to your own testing with Total Hardness which includes magnesium
since that is what test strips are mostly limited to testing. As you
can tell, it's probably wrong. Once you get your K-2006 you can get the
CH to 150 ppm to reduce foaming though I suspect your CH might already
be that high or higher given your well water. You will want to lower
your TA at some point though initially when using Dichlor you may be
OK if you find your pH not rising too fast. You'll want to order the
boric acid to get 50 ppm borates and can do so from DudaDiesel or The
Chemistry Store. You'll add that just before switching from Dichlor to
bleach and after you've gotten your TA down to 50 ppm.


<a href="http://www.troublefreepool.com/threads/72024-Fresh-Fill-Now-What" target="_blank">TikiTime - Fresh Fill - Now What</a>

### bridgeman

If you're using dichlor then bleach the CYA won't come up immediately,
so focus on getting the right FC level and keep track of the amount of
dichlor you add, then switch to bleach when you've added that amount.

30 ppm of CYA is a good number, and also happens to be the lowest level
my test kit can reliably read. I ran with 20 ppm CYA until I got a good
test kit, then I raised it to 30 so the test kit could measure it. There's
probably something fundamentally wrong with that but I can live with it

There's an "Effects of adding chemicals" section near the bottom you
can use to figure out the total amount of dichlor required to reach your
target CYA level, although you have to do it via the "trial and error"
approach (hint - try 3 oz of dichlor). For my tub (which is larger than
yours) a *total* of 6 oz of dichlor is enough to take CYA just past 30
ppm, so I dose with dichlor according to what PoolMath tells me until
I get to a total of 6 oz, then switch to dosing with bleach.

Note that the target FC range per PoolMath is 1-3 ppm when you have 0
CYA (fresh fill) and 2-6 ppm when you have 30 ppm CYA (where I switch to
bleach). In a perfect world you would ramp up your target FC as you get
closer to the target CYA level, but you could probably keep your target
at 3 until you reach 30ppm CYA and then set your target to 6. By target
I mean the FC level you dose up to, with the idea being that it will be
lower but still in range when you test the next day.

I have only run through the exercise once (twice if you count discovering
the dichlor/bleach method after running the tub on dichlor-only for
a while) -- the water has been so nice and clean I haven't bothered
changing it for a few months now.

### chem geek

Yeah, that 7 ppm FC is PER 350 GALLONS. It would only be 3.5 ppm FC
in 700 gallons. The amount of chlorine is absolute per person-hour of
soaking. The FC level corresponding to that will vary depending on the
spa size. The typical spa store recommendations of adding some fixed
amount after a soak are on the right track and they usually say it's
an amount per person, but they don't usually say anything about it also
being proportional to how long you soak.

Then there are subtleties such as water temperature (one sweats more
at higher temperature) and whether one has an ozonator. Ozone oxidizes
both bather waste as well as chlorine so in high bather-load situations
ozone reduces the amount of chlorine you need but in low bather-load
situations (i.e. days of no use in between soaks) it increases the amount
of (background dose) chlorine you need.

### chem geek

Since I don't know what specific other chemicals you are using, it's
hard to say. Some systems use a phosphate pH buffer and that will
certainly precipitate calcium (as calcium phosphate). If you go with
Dichlor-then-bleach, I target 50 ppm for the TA and use 50 ppm Borates
as well. Other than that, everything else is described correctly in
Using Chlorine in a Spa.

Re: Are hot tubs really supposed to be such a pain?

No, hot tubs are not a pain. My hot tub is way easier to maintain than
my pool because it is smaller and covered and not plaster.

I drained my tub yesterday for the first time in a year. Just because
it seemed like I should, since people say you should drain your hot tub
every 3-6 months. I also hosed off the filter for the first time in a
year. Water was completely clear before and after. The only difference
this morning was the water was a little less salty because my wife hasn't
dumped any epsom salts in it yet. And it smelled a little chloriney
yesterday because the CYA hadn't dissolved yet. Chlorine smell was gone
this morning.

Our hot tub is 340 gallons. I get in it every day for at least 30
minutes. Wife and I hang out in it for a couple of hours almost every
weekend and often more. Sometimes like 6-8 hours.

All I put in my hot tub is bleach, cya and muriatic acid. And epsom
salts. Since I drained it yesterday I've got a sock in it with 1.8 oz
of CYA in it. Per poolmath above, to put my CYA at 40ppm. I add about
1/4 cup of bleach per bather hour after use. If we skip a day I don't
usually do anything, if we skip two then I'll test chlorine and add a
little bleach if needed. I test ph every week or two at least and add
a little acid to lower ph. Our ph only ever goes up.

There is a little table by the tub with a jug of bleach a 1/4 cup
measuring cup and a Taylor chlorine/ph test box.


### Swampwoman

Re: Are hot tubs really supposed to be such a pain?

ChemGeek, I do the same thing with 1" trichlor tabs in this kind of
dispenser: http://www.spadepot.com/shop/Floatin...1ouxoCK0rw_wcB

...And then oxidize with bleach to supplement. By keeping it almost
"closed" I get a small residual for between soaks. One downside is
that with constantly creeping CYA, I change the water more and remain
conscious of the ratio, eg use a little more liquid chlorine when I'm
about due for a water change

I have generally found it easy to maintain my hot tub this way.

Maybe this info will help the OP arrive at something that works. I love
my hot tub but likely love it more since I've arrived at an approach
that works a little better for me. (I'm allergic to bromine and didn't
have great luck with the mineral approach.)

### chem geek


Re: Are hot tubs really supposed to be such a pain?

Got it. At least with Trichlor, the CYA doesn't climb as quickly as with
Dichlor and if you use it just for background dosing then it's really not
that much, especially given the roughly 5 ppm CYA monthly loss typical
in spas from oxidation by chlorine. One just needs to periodically add
some baking soda since the TA will slowly drop from the Trichlor usage
(which is like adding acid). For every 10 ppm FC added by Trichlor,
after chlorine consumption/usage it lowers TA by 7.1 ppm (and carbonate
alkalinity by 9.0 ppm after pH rises back to where it started from carbon
dioxide outgassing).

The Nature2 with MPS system works, but usually needs a little help with
periodic dosing with chlorine to keep the water crystal clear. MPS doesn't
oxidize the same things that chlorine does. It doesn't oxidize ammonia
very quickly, for example. Not sure it does much with urea. Of course,
using bleach (after initial Dichlor) is the least expensive approach.

### chem geek


Re: Are hot tubs really supposed to be such a pain?

Even a brand new hot tub can have bacterial biofilms in it because if
the manufacturer or spa dealer does not thoroughly dry out the piping
after wet testing, then bacterial biofilms can form. There can also be
greases/oils from manufacturing leftover. That why a new spa or one you
get used with an unknown history should get cleaned out using Ahh-Some.

In your own spa, if you don't have all areas disinfected at nearly all
times, the spa can go south pretty quickly. It only takes bacteria 15-60
minutes to double in population so one bacteria can turn into over 4
billion in 8 hours under the most ideal of growth conditions.

Isaac-1 Re: Which water test kit of these is the best?

Reply #4 on: May 08, 2014, 06:59:23 PM - I think the big question here
is how do you plan to manage your tub, are you going to use Chlorine or
Bromine, or something else?  If Chlorine what are you going to use to
chlorinate, dichlor, bleach, etc?  I have the TF-100 which I use for my
swimming pool, and occasionally for my hot tub, but most of the time I
just use a simple OTO Chlorine / pH test for the hot tub, as it tells
me most of what I care about on a daily basis, once I get things fine
tuned after a fresh refill using the TF-100.

# ProTeam GentleSpa

### Nitro at TFP - How do I use Chlorine in my Spa (or pool)? 

Lastly, there is one more thing I haven't mentioned that you can add
to your tub that will help buffer your pH, Borates. The easiest way to
add Borates to your tub is to get a product called Gentle Spa. It is pH
balanced, so there is no need to add acid to counter balance it. The
ideal amount is ~50 ppm, and only needs to be added once per water
change. That will help keep your pH from drifting from aeration. Not to
mention, actually make your water feel silkier. I highly recommend it.
