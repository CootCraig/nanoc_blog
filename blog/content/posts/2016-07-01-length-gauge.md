<pre>
The “bars” are made of 1/4” thick pine.
The “fences” are made of 1/8” pine but plywood is ok
The round edges are cut from curtain rail but a dowel or broomstick will do.

I made the fences so I can hold the bars with one hand and clamp with
the other hand.

I made the round edges after I got tired to clean the glue squeeze-out
from the “Schpitz” (German for apex) of the bars.
