  9mm Luger vs. 9mm NATO
</h4>
The different names we have now are the product of three different
things. 9×19 comes from the cartridge’s dimensions, 9mm Parabellum
was the name it was originally given, and 9mm Luger is its official name
according to SAAMI. They are all the same cartridge.

9mm NATO rounds have higher pressures than standard 9mm Luger rounds. To
make a comparison, a 9mm NATO round would be like a 9mm +P round in terms
of pressure. That’s the biggest difference. 9mm NATO is a bit spicier
than 9mm Luger. It’s accurate and reliable, but it’s definitely
snappier because it’s designed to hit 1250+ feet per second out of a
standard pistol. Most commercial 9mm ammo is going around 1100 feet per
second with a 115 grain bullet.

  9×19mm Parabellum
</h4>
<pre>
9x19 parabellum
9mm luger
</pre>
The 9×19 mm Parabellum (abbreviated 9 mm, 9 mmP, 9×19 mm or 9×19)
cartridge was designed by Georg Luger and introduced in 1902 by the
German weapons manufacturer Deutsche Waffen- und Munitionsfabriken
(DWM) for their Luger semi-automatic pistol.[5] For this reason, it is
designated as the 9 mm Luger / 9 mm Luger +P by the SAAMI[6] and the 9
mm Luger by the C.I.P. (differentiating it from the 9 mm Makarov and 9
mm Browning cartridges). Under STANAG 4090, it is a standard cartridge
for NATO forces as well as many non-NATO countries.[7]

The name Parabellum is derived from the Latin: Si vis pacem, para bellum
("If you seek peace, prepare for war"), which was the motto of DWM.[8][9]

According to the 2006 edition of Cartridges of the World, the 9×19 mm
Parabellum is "the world's most popular and widely used military handgun
cartridge."[10] In addition to being used by over 60% of police in the
U.S., Newsweek credits 9×19 mm Parabellum pistol sales with making
semiautomatic pistols more popular than revolvers.[11] The popularity of
this cartridge can be attributed to the widely held conviction that it
is effective in police and self-defense use.[12] Its low cost and wide
availability contribute to the caliber's continuing popularity.
