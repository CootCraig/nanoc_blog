Veneering may be the best of all hide glue applications. You can get
veneers down on flat or contoured edges and surfaces without worrying
about perfect placement as you must with contact cement. You can
create perfect butt joints by cutting them after the veneers are down,
you can repair bubbles easily and positively, and you can do the whole
job without clamps. Veneering with hide glue may be doing yourself or
your customers a favor in more ways than one. When a piece of furniture
suffers damage that calls for repairing or replacing some of the veneer,
the owner or repair specialist can simply iron a damp towel on the veneer,
melting the glue and allowing easy removal of the entire piece.

Tage claims that with a household iron, an adequate supply of veneer,
a large enough glue pot and a veneer hammer, you could veneer the
entire planet. The veneer hammer looks like a cross between a hammer
and a squeegee; the hammer head is used as a hand hold (and for setting
veneer pins), and the smoothly blunted blade is used to press the veneer
down firmly and squeeze out excess glue. Edges usually can be done hot;
large surfaces may be done at your leisure, reheating the glue with an
iron set between wool and cotton on the heat dial. The hammer veneering
process is covered in clear detail in the bookTage Frid Teaches
