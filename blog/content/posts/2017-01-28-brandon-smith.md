  How To Defeat The Globalist System by Brandon Smith - Friday, 27 January 2017 04:35
</h4>

In my last two articles, 'How Globalists Predict Your Behavior' and 'How
To Predict The Behavior Of Globalists', I explained the base fundamentals
behind a concept with which most people are unfamiliar. They are so
unfamiliar with it, in fact, that I didnâ€™t bother to name it. In this
article I hope to explain it, but I highly recommend people read the
previous articles in this series before moving forward.

What I outlined, essentially, was a beginners course on 4th Generation
Warfare. This methodology is difficult to summarize, but here I will
list what I believe are some of its core tenets.
