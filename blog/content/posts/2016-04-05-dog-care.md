##### Amazon Review By S. P.  Another excellent product from Virbac

I volunteer for a poodle rescue group and rehabilitate a lot of neglected
animals. Neglected poodles suffer badly since their breed needs washing
and grooming or their hair mats, can stay damp, and becomes filthy. This
leads to all kinds of bacterial and yeast infections of the skin, eyes,
and ears. My current foster dog has a severe case of Malassezia yeast
and Pseudomonas in both ears and a generalized yeast skin infection. The
smell is horrendous so I can appreciate the odor control ingredients in
this product. The ingredients help break up the bio-film that Pseudomonas
forms in the ear and this is absolutely necessary for any medication to
work. Obviously, the dog I am fostering needs and is receiving veterinary
care and Rx medications to get her condition under control. I use the
Epi Otic Advanced in conjunction with these meds and will recommend that
her new owners use Epi Otic Advanced once or twice a week to hopefully
prevent future ear infections. Dogs with allergies and other underlying
conditions which compromise the skin, make a dog prone to ear infections
and regular hygiene with Epi Otic Advanced is a must.

Before using any ear washes or medications, please have a veterinarian
check the ear first to make sure the ear drum is intact. Any chemical
put in the ear when the ear drum is ruptured can lead to deafness.

My favorite ear products are Epi-Otic original for normal hygiene,
Epi-Otic Advanced for shelter dogs, ear infections, and maintenance
for dogs prone to ear infections and zymox ear medications. Use all
medications liberally and for an extended period of time to make sure you
wipe out the entire infection. If your dog currently has an infection or
is prone to ear infections, please skip the home-made vinegar, alcohol
type treatments and use the scientifically formulated stuff. Your dog
deserves to live without ear pain.

  Ear Infection: The Number 1 Reason Dogs Visited the Vet in 2011

For taking care of healthy canine ears, my favorite cleaning agents include:

<ul>
  <li>Witch hazel</li>
  <li>Organic apple cider vinegar and purified water, mixed equal parts</li>
  <li>Hydrogen peroxide</li>
  <li>Green tea infusion (using tea that has been cooled, of course)</li>
  <li>Tea tree oil greatly diluted in purified water (for dogs only â€“ never cats)</li>
</ul>

Notice alcohol isn't on the list. That's because it can cause burning
and irritation, especially if there's inflammation.
