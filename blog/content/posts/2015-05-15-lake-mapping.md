LakeTrax is currently powering Insight Genesis™ launched with Lowrance


Lake Mapping Software for Anglers

LakeTrax is currently powering Insight Genesis™ launched with
Lowrance. This new service gives fishing and boating enthusiasts access
to powerful web-based lake mapping software. Passionate anglers can now
understand a lake by developing a detailed trip log.


Bottom Hardness & Vegetation Maps

Identify key, fish-holding areas using bottom composition and vegetation
mapping, which is NOT available anywhere else. No additonal equipment
required as content is created with sonar signals from your existing
Lowrance, Simrad or B&G transducer.

## Simrad

Simrad NSS8 - $1300

## biobase


What depth finders are used with the ciBioBase System?

CI BioBase is compatible with Lowrance™ brand depth finder that have
.SLG and .SL2 (Structure Scan) log file recording capability. We currently
recommend the HDS line. Navico, Inc. can provide the HDS models at a
discounted price or as part of your subscription package. Please contact
us for more information.

OpenDroneMap is a tool to postprocess small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(sUAS), balloon, kite, and street view data to geographic data. With
the current update, we are adding the ability to create orthophotos from
drone, balloon, and kite imagery which has GPS ephemeris.

The financial support from 2 major partners (who prefer not to be in the spotlights but who's help and advice is invaluable) and the guidance by IHO's management team (Robert Ward and David Wyatt in Monaco), Jenifer Austin at Google in Mountain View and Lisa Taylor's team at NOAA in Colorado - thank you very much to all.

Undersea Terrain Elevation (Bathymetry)

in general, unlike terrestrial elevation data, undersea data points tend
to not lie on regular grids, and tend to be much denser near landmasses

Subject: OpenStreetMap freshwater crowd source bathymetry?

I just started fishing, my home water is Pueblo Reservoir in
Pueblo, Colorado.  I would love to make depth and shoreline
measurements and get them into an OpenStreetMap based database
ala depth.OpenSeaMap.org.  Do you know of any existing project
or resources for me to look at.

Thanks,
Craig Anderson

Sonar log recording tutorials - Lowrance

Lowrance has changed their software which now excludes depth data when
exporting sonar logs in the GPX format. If you purchase a new Lowrance
plotter, you can no longer use GPX to upload sonar logs. If you update
the software of an older plotter, the same result can happen. Check this
page, which is continuously updated. Please contact Lowrance customer
service for any questions. Now there is a new fun and effortless way to
upload sonar logs! All you need is the Navionics Boating app connected
wirelessly to a sounder to enjoy SonarCharts™ Live and at the same
time upload sonar logs.

Collecting Track Log Data on a Humminbird GPS Unit

Logging Sonar Data

The preferred source of Humminbird data for import into ReefMaster is
logged sonar data. Sonar logs provide explicit time information for
track-points which is important when tide adjusting track data.

·Ensure that you have a memory card with sufficient free space inserted
into your Humminbird unit.

·On arrival at your area of interest, select the option start recording
to start logging data.

·Record the data. This step might simply involve drifting and fishing
for a few hours, or maybe a more systematic approach if you are mapping
out a new area.

·Stop recording when you are done mapping an area.
 

Recorded sonar data is stored on the card in the RECORD directory. To
import Humminbird a sonar log file into ReefMaster, select the RNNNNN.DAT
file.
