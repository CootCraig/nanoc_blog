Crowd-Sourced Bathymetry

The financial support from 2 major partners (who prefer not to be in the spotlights but who's help and advice is invaluable) and the guidance by IHO's management team (Robert Ward and David Wyatt in Monaco), Jenifer Austin at Google in Mountain View and Lisa Taylor's team at NOAA in Colorado - thank you very much to all.

Undersea Terrain Elevation (Bathymetry)

in general, unlike terrestrial elevation data, undersea data points tend
to not lie on regular grids, and tend to be much denser near landmasses

Subject: OpenStreetMap freshwater crowd source bathymetry?

I just started fishing, my home water is Pueblo Reservoir in
Pueblo, Colorado.  I would love to make depth and shoreline
measurements and get them into an OpenStreetMap based database
ala depth.OpenSeaMap.org.  Do you know of any existing project
or resources for me to look at.

Thanks,
Craig Anderson
