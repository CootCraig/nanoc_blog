### Named Workspaces

#### 6.5.2. Renaming workspaces

You can rename workspaces. This might be useful to start with the default
numbered workspaces, do your work, and rename the workspaces afterwards
to reflect what’s actually on them. You can also omit the old name
to rename the currently focused workspace. This is handy if you want to
use the rename command with i3-input.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
i3-msg 'rename workspace to "2: irc"'

bindsym $mod+n exec i3-input -F 'rename workspace to "%s"' -P 'New name: '
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## i3 debian development autobuild repo

* [Michael Stapelberg - Debian and Ubuntu repositories](http://i3wm.org/docs/repositories.html)

### 1. When should you use our repositories?

#### You want the latest i3 development version

If you are using Debian (Debian-derived systems might work, too) or
Ubuntu and want the latest development version of i3, you should use
our Debian repository.

### 3. Debian repository

Our Debian repository contains packages which are automatically built
a few minutes after every commit. To use it, run the following commands:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/i3-autobuild.list
echo 'deb http://build.i3wm.org/debian/sid sid main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/i3-autobuild.list
apt-get update
apt-get --allow-unauthenticated install i3-autobuild-keyring
apt-get update
apt-get install i3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Asked on #i3 - Tue Dec 16 09:03:50 MST 2014

Reading 6.5.1. Named workspaces in the User's Guide.  I don't understand
how to do a rename command.
