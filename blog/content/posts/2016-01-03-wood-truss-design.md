* skillion roof (in Australia)
* sloping flat truss

A mono-pitched roof is a single-sloping roof surface, often not attached
to another roof surface. Mono-pitched roofs are sometimes called a pent
roof, shed roof, lean-to roof,[1] or skillion roof (in Australia). This
is in contrast to a dual-pitched roof, also known as a gabled roof,
which is pitched in two different directions.

A mono-pitched roof can also be a smaller addition to an existing roof,
where keeping to the same slope (roof pitch) puts the mono-pitched roof
lower than the ceiling height of the main structure. In this case even
though the main roof has a flat ceiling, the mono-pitched part will have
a sloping, or raked, ceiling line to maximise the ceiling height. The
name lean-to roof comes from this form of addition.

Mono-pitched roofs can also be used to provide clerestory windows for a
hallway or similar room where a row of windows is placed below the edge
of the mono-pitched section reaching above the other roof below.

#### Structure of the monoslope roof

Monopitched Roof of Skillion roof mainly depends on gravity in order to
maintain the integrity of its structure. One of the major advantages of
this kind of roofing is that they can be easily constructed without much
hassle within a very short span of time. The process of constructing
a monopitched roof is more than simple and doesn’t require too many
hands when compared with the gabled roofing. As a result monopitched
roofing construction can be completed in very less time and doesn’t
involve too much expense. Traditionally these kinds of roof were mainly
built for garages but more and more people are now opting for monopitch
roof truss for their homes. The monopitch roof system doesn’t come
with many members which is one reason which helps this kind of roof to
equally distribute its load to the load bearing walls which have been
placed near the roof both internally and externally.

#### <a href="http://myrooff.com/single-pitch-roof/" target="_blank">Single Pitch Roof</a>

A single pitched roof is a roof that has a single pitch in one
direction. They go by many names, including pent roofs, shed roof, lean-
to roofs, or skillion roofs. They are commonly used in sheds, and homes
designed in the modern style. They are often associated with simple home
and building plans, as they do not require any special skill sets or
craftsmanship. However, simple does not necessarily mean boring. Single
pitch roofs can often be striking, and give a sense of character to the
home or building. Today, many new modern construction homes and buildings
favor the single pitched roof for its clean lines and simple plans.

...

Single slope roof home plans often require little variation in materials
and coloring, preferring to maintain a simple and sharp look. Typically,
the home would follow the design of one material – wood, steel, brick,
or any other material. It rarely changes shades, the roofing being a
different color from the main house, but that is all.
