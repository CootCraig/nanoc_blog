## pac-clad snap-on standing seam metal roof panels


<a href="https://www.pac-clad.com/metal-roofing/snap-on-standing-seam/" target="_blank">standing seam metal roof panels</a>

Snap-On Standing Seam metal roofing panels are designed for use in
roofing, mansard and fascia applications. The panels are designed to be
installed over a waterproofed solid substrate and a minimum 3:12 roof
pitch. Snap-On Metal Panels are to be factory roll-formed in continuous
lengths. Maximum panel length is 45 feet and minimum panel length is
4 feet.

These metal panels are ideal for specification on applications where
roofing transitions are required. The simplicity of the pan design
combined with corrective leveling provides superior flatness and allows
for greater workability on site.



## Woodaware Trusses

#### Components

Metal-plate-connected wood trusses are the predominant type of truss
used in residential construction. They are typically fabricated from
2x4 or 2x6 dimension lumber. Trusses are categorized as "parallel" chord
for use in floor and flat roof applications or "pitch" chord for sloped
roof applications.

In a roof truss, the three sides (or perimeter elements) of the triangle
are called "chords." The "webs" are wood pieces connecting the top and
bottom chords. Chords and webs are the "members" or elements of the
truss. The "connectors" joining chords and webs in modern trusses are
usually metal-toothed plates.

#### Manufacture of Trusses

Trusses are designed using sophisticated software that accurately
calculates the structural load conditions in accordance with building
code requirements. During construction is the best time to see how
a truss roof system is configured and distributes loads. Almost as
soon as trusses are set in place, maybe even the same day, the roof
sheathing is attached. This quick construction time prevents inspectors
from having a good opportunity to see the framing from outside the
building. Fortunately, everything the fire service and building inspector
need to see is visible from inside the structure during the complete
building framing inspection. The web and chord elements are fabricated
to exact dimensions. The pieces are arranged in their final orientation
and the metal plates are applied using equipment capable of exerting
high pressure to embed the metal-plate teeth. Trusses are inspected
for proper plate orientation and plate-teeth penetration depth prior to
shipment to the job site.

#### Performance Requirements for Code Acceptance

Metal-plate-connected wood trusses are designed and manufactured
in accordance with ANSI/TPI1 National Design Standard for Metal
Plate Connected Wood Truss Construction¹, as specified by the
building code (International Residential Code 2003, Section R802.10.2,
International Building Code 2003, Section 2303.4). More details regarding
metal-plate-connected wood trusses can be found in the Metal Plate
Connected Wood Truss Handbook².

## Monopitch Roof

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono-pitched_roof" target="_blank">Wikipedia - mono pitched roof</a>

* Monopitch roof
* pent roof
* shed roof
* lean-to roof
* skillion roof (in Australia)
* sloping flat truss

A mono-pitched roof is a single-sloping roof surface, often not attached
to another roof surface. Mono-pitched roofs are sometimes called a pent
roof, shed roof, lean-to roof,[1] or skillion roof (in Australia). This
is in contrast to a dual-pitched roof, also known as a gabled roof,
which is pitched in two different directions.

A mono-pitched roof can also be a smaller addition to an existing roof,
where keeping to the same slope (roof pitch) puts the mono-pitched roof
lower than the ceiling height of the main structure. In this case even
though the main roof has a flat ceiling, the mono-pitched part will have
a sloping, or raked, ceiling line to maximise the ceiling height. The
name lean-to roof comes from this form of addition.

Mono-pitched roofs can also be used to provide clerestory windows for a
hallway or similar room where a row of windows is placed below the edge
of the mono-pitched section reaching above the other roof below.

#### Structure of the monoslope roof

Monopitched Roof of Skillion roof mainly depends on gravity in order to
maintain the integrity of its structure. One of the major advantages of
this kind of roofing is that they can be easily constructed without much
hassle within a very short span of time. The process of constructing
a monopitched roof is more than simple and doesn’t require too many
hands when compared with the gabled roofing. As a result monopitched
roofing construction can be completed in very less time and doesn’t
involve too much expense. Traditionally these kinds of roof were mainly
built for garages but more and more people are now opting for monopitch
roof truss for their homes. The monopitch roof system doesn’t come
with many members which is one reason which helps this kind of roof to
equally distribute its load to the load bearing walls which have been
placed near the roof both internally and externally.

### myroof.com Single Pitch Roof

#### <a href="http://myrooff.com/single-pitch-roof/" target="_blank">Single Pitch Roof</a>

A single pitched roof is a roof that has a single pitch in one
direction. They go by many names, including pent roofs, shed roof, lean-
to roofs, or skillion roofs. They are commonly used in sheds, and homes
designed in the modern style. They are often associated with simple home
and building plans, as they do not require any special skill sets or
craftsmanship. However, simple does not necessarily mean boring. Single
pitch roofs can often be striking, and give a sense of character to the
home or building. Today, many new modern construction homes and buildings
favor the single pitched roof for its clean lines and simple plans.

...

Single slope roof home plans often require little variation in materials
and coloring, preferring to maintain a simple and sharp look. Typically,
the home would follow the design of one material – wood, steel, brick,
or any other material. It rarely changes shades, the roofing being a
different color from the main house, but that is all.

NetGen it's a powerful 3D tetrahedral mesh generatorl that can handle
complex geometries and a great variety of meshing options, the tetrahedral
meshs as those created with Netgen are the best option on the selection
of a discretization theorem for a non conventional bodycas long as it
can handle a decent meshing density , wich it's possible with the use
of current medium-high level processing units. The tetrahedral elements
can adjust more easily to the curves and spline surfaces of the model,
preserving its proportion form.

On NetGen a 3D model can be meshed under a great variety of meshing
controls in order to adjust de meshing density to the desired
especifications.
