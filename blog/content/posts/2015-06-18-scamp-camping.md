* GPS: 38.554325, -106.116013

The road in is Dirt and 3 miles from a paved road. NW Poncha Springs
BLM is open Summer. There are 16-29 campsites at this location and the
maximum RV length is any. You may stay 14 nights at NW Poncha Springs BLM.

One of my personal favorite free camping locations. Somewhat remote, not
bad. Able to get an RV in there easily, road is in good condition. Can
get a little dusty from cars passing the area. People tend to mind their
own business.  No bathrooms, bring a groover. No water, bring your own.
Quite possible cows may pass through your camp at night, so don’t freak
out. BTW, there bears here also. So if you hear something moving around,
tell yourself it’s a cow and go back to sleep. LOL

29 miles southwest of La Veta, CO, in the San Isabel National Forest,
San Carlos Ranger District. Go south on Highway 12 for 24 miles, and
turn right (west) on County Road 34 (also listed as F.S. RD 34, CR 34.5,
or North Fork Road & turns into Forest Service Road 411). 37.244931,
-105.100946

This site is one of several free, camping-allowed pull-offs along the
road, at the end of which is the Purgatoire Campground (a pay campground
$17/night). The dirt road is rough, rocky and rutted in some spots,
but mostly in pretty good shape- I made it in my car.

There's a 4-wheel-drive-only road heading off from another pull-off
further up the road from this site, and a trailhead for the North
Fork Trail (#1309) is located on the north side of the Purgatoire
Campground. There are also several other trails in the general
area. There's fishing in the North Fork Purgatoire River all along the
road, and in nearby North, Bear, Blue, and Monument Lakes.

There wasn't much shade at this particular site, but we were there early
in the season (end of May), after a colder and wetter than normal Spring,
so it might be a bit better later on, after the aspens have leafed
out. It's between the creek and the road, in a pretty narrow valley,
with wooded and rocky alpine peaks surrounding. Trinchera Peak, Cuatro
Peak and the Spanish Peaks are nearby.

There are a couple of decent spots for tents and a large, open, fairly
flat parking area for campers/RVs. It's pretty much a back-in, not a
pull-through; though most normal vehicles and smaller rigs can probably
turn around in the parking area without much trouble. We fit 2 trucks
and a car, side by side.

Nearby towns: Cuchara, La Veta, Walsenburg, Stonewall, Weston.

This is just a gravel lot with a vault toilet. Signs state that camping
is allowed in self contained RVs. There's a pipe with spring water. We
saw people filling jugs and water bottles but we don't know if it's
really safe. A trail starts from the northeast corner of the lot. The
area is very pretty with grassy meadows, little lakes and views of the
mountains ranges.

There are four more parking lots on the outskirts of the wildlife area
and one in the middle. We tried checking on the middle one but the road
was gated. Most of the area is closed from February 15 through July 15
to protect wintering and nesting waterfowl.

Small loop of sites in San Isabel Nat. Forest just off of 12 Mile Rd./ Hwy
78 between Beulah & San Isabel (CO Hwy. 165)in a small meadow surrounded
by forest, with some sites farther back from the road in the trees. 12
Mile has occasional traffic, but over all, very quiet. Another small
meadow with trailhead just across the road (San Carlos or St. Charles,
don't remember which. I marked it hiking and horse only because I don't
remember whether bikes and/or ATVs are allowed.)

Editors Note: This dispersed camping area is located in the San Carlos
Ranger District of the San Isabel National Forest. It is first come,
first served – no reservations. It is not an official campground so
there are no facilities nor is it maintained. Hwy 78 is a maintained,
wide, and dirt road (check it out in google street view). If you have
specific questions, you should contact the ranger district. So that
they know where you are talking about, I would ask them about “the
dispersed camping area on hwy right across the road from the San Carlos
Trailhead.” Here is their contact information:

## [fiberglassrv.com/forums](http://www.fiberglassrv.com/forums/f66/lakehead-boat-basin-duluth-mn-66738.html) Lakehead Boat Basin, Duluth, MN

Ms. Gayle - Last week I spent a night at Lakehead Boat Basin in Duluth,
MN. I was overnighting and had read about this very small (18 sites)
RV option. It is located 3 blocks from Canal Park (waterfront shopping,
restaurants, museum, etc). For me the RV option was fine. You are right in
the marina watching boats go by while the aerial bridge goes up and down.

## [fiberglassrv.com/forums](http://www.fiberglassrv.com/forums/f66/missouris-ozark-national-scenic-riverways-67001.html) Missouri's Ozark National Scenic Riverways

Missouri Mark - Missouri's Ozark National Scenic Riverways

In appreciation for all the advice and knowledge I have learned since
discovering Fiberglass RV forum, I will offer my recommendations for
anyone who finds themselves passing thru Missouri in the future and
looking to camp in scenic surroundings...

Most will travel I 44 or I 70 going west or east, or I 55 heading north
or south, passing thru Missouri. Stretching across the entire length of
southern Missouri is US Hwy 60, a much improved, nice 4 lane highway,
that travels across the Ozark Mountains. There are an abundance of
camping opportunities on Missouri's Ozark National Scenic Riverways,
which include the Current River, the Jack's Fork River, a the Eleven
Point River. Developed campgrounds with electric and water exist at
Round Springs, Alley Springs, and Big Springs. Undeveloped campgrounds
can be found at the numerous access points to the rivers. Clean spring
fed streams that run thru deep valleys is the wilderness you can expect.

Many places you can pull your camper close to the water's edge. Most
CG will have vault toilets and running water. But those wanting to get
off the beaten path, check with the numerous Department of Conservation
offices located along Hwy 60 on where to camp. Lots of beautiful places to
camp within 20 miles of the Hwy 60 corridor that will offer great scenery,
solitude, fishing, hiking, campfires, and cheap float trips with several
canoe rental places that operate year round with some advance notice in
the winter months, a phone call will be enough to have someone take care
of you.

Thank God that the people of southern Missouri stood up in the '40s
and '50s and demanded that these streams would always remain in their
pristine conditions. If you haven't experienced the Missouri Ozarks,
give yourself a treat and spend a few days camping on one of our streams.

And you will most likely always find yourself within a 20 minute drive
to a small town for supplies if needed.

Anyone interested in some ideal spots for boondocking, send me a message.
