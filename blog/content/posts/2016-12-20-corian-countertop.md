At SolidSurface.com, you can find the sheet material for your next Corian
countertop. We also offer other leading brands at exclusive prices in
our overstock and discontinued full and partial sheets as well as our
selection of fully stocked brands section. Solid surface, best known
for DuPont Corian countertops, is a great solution for your new kitchen
or bath counters because, unlike granite or quartz, solid surface is
workable with regular woodworking tools. It needs no sealer coat which
means stains, blemishes, and scratches can be easily wiped or sanded
away. To add to it, Corian, and competing brands, are all non-porous,
food-safe surfaces and can have an entirely seamless look when properly
installed. With these benefits, it’s no surprise that Corian kitchen
countertops, and the like, have been a popular interior design addition
for over forty years.

SolidSurface.com is a leader in supplying full sheets of great countertops
for your home. Be sure to see how great a new Corian bathroom countertop
would look in your guest or master bathroom. SolidSurface.com is proud
to offer a wide variety of colors and styles in our Corian Countertops
to match the perfect size and color you need to give your interior home
design the elegant finishing touch it needs.

Look through our extensive catalog of brands of solid surface including
our own our own House Premium, Samsung Staron, LG HI-MACS, Wilsonart,
Formica, Avonite, Meganite, Hanex, and of course the well known Corian
countertop. If you have any questions about our great product offerings,
be sure to contact us and one of our sales representatives will help
you through the process of finding the exact solid surface or Corian
product you need for your home, commercial, or other project.
