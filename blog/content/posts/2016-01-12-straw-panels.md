ModCell® is one of the first products to make large-scale,
carbon-negative building a commercial reality.

The ModCell® system utilises the excellent thermal insulation qualities
of straw bale construction to form prefabricated panels.

ModCell® allows super-insulated, high-performance, low energy
‘passive’ buildings to be built using renewable, locally sourced,
carbon sequestering materials that include straw bale and hemp to create
a less than zero carbon construction system.
