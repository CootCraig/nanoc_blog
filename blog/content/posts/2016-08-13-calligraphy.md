  Roundhand
</h4>

Round Hand (also Roundhand) is a type of handwriting and calligraphy
originating in England in the 1660s primarily by the writing masters John
Ayres and William Banson. Characterised by an open flowing hand and subtle
contrast of thick and thin strokes deriving from metal pointed nibs,
its popularity grew rapidly, becoming codified as a standard through
the publication of printed writing manuals.

Thomson, George L., The Art of Calligraphy: How to Master Broad Pen Scripts (London, 1986)

First published in 1985 as The Calligraphy Workbook: How to Master Broad
Pen Script which is now the only one I can find listed.

This is a tremendously comforting calligraphy book. It contains nothing
much but 'four easy scripts' – uncial, roundhand, blackletter (gothic)
and italic – and instructions on how to make your own pen. Its beauty is
the sheer size of the examples Thomson provides. They are huge, a good
two-to-five inches high, and laid out mid-page between lines so they
are easily traceable. Every stroke is clearly visible and you really
can use your whole hand and arm to write with at that scale, which,
funnily enough, then makes it easier to write smaller. If you ever feel
faintly cramped by little exemplars, this particular calligraphy book is
the solution. Oh, and it's ring-bound, so it stays open and flat exactly
where you want it.

Roundhand (Foundation hand)

Roundhand is a modern, twentieth-century calligraphy alphabet based on
the scripts of the Italian Renaissance, which themselves were invented
because Italian scholars (in particular) had got heartily fed up of
trying to read long texts written in tiny, cramped Gothic.

The great virtue of Roundhand is its simplicity. It may seem like a
humble virtue but it is not therefore to be disregarded. Any Roundhand
lends itself to circumstances in which you want to communicate sincerely
and without pretension: poems by Robert Frost, instructions in case of
zombie attack, children's alphabet posters, letters of advice to your
younger self, diaries for publication, etc.
