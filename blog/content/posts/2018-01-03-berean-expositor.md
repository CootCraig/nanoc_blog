Welcome to the Charles Welch web site. You’ll find over 2,000 free
dispensational Bible study recordings and writings promoting the Bible
study principle of “rightly dividing the Word of Truth.” We encourage
you to open your Bible and become a Berean, (Acts 17:11) searching the
scriptures to see if what is taught is doctrinally sound and true.

  And just what is Dispensationalism?
</h3>

In a nutshell, Dispensationalism is based upon a separation between
Israel and the church – scriptures which were written exclusively
to Israel do not apply to the church today, and scriptures written to
the church do not apply to Israel. The church today is not “spiritual
Israel”, and cannot claim promises which the Lord made to Israel alone
(such as His promise to give Israel an earthly kingdom; see Mt. 5:5,
in which the Lord quoted from Psalms 37:11; see also Deut. 28:1 and
Zech. 14:17). Even though non-Dispensationalists also admit that certain
Old Testament commandments no longer apply to believers today (such as the
Old Testament sacrifices and dietary laws), these non-Dispensationalists
do not go so far as to separate the church today from Israel.
