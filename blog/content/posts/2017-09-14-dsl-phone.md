Wilcom PS-36 Wall-mount VDSL2 POTS Splitter

The Wilcom PS-36 Master Splitter is a passive low-pass filter designed
to provide POTS service in concert with VDSL2 technology. The device
blocks high frequency (20kHz-30MHz) energy from interfering with voice
equipment and prevents POTS noise from causing data errors on the xDSL
connection. The PS-36 is backwards compatible with all xDSL systems.

The Wilcom PS-36 is ideally suited for video over xDSL applications such
as IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) by providing robust ringtrip
protection for non-zero coss ringers to eliminate video pixelization
during off-hook and ring-trip events.

The PS-36 can be easily mounted inside the customer premises where the
phone service enters the building. Two types of connection options are
supported by the PS-36 splitter: a screw-type terminal block and standard
RJ jacks. This allows the installer to simply connect the existing premise
wiring to the PHONE connector or RJ jack on the splitter, and have POTS
service up and running within minutes without expensive and time-consuming
rewiring. A "home-run" connection with data-grade cable is recommended
direct to the xDSL modem from the ATU-R/MODEM connection on the splitter.

Model PS-36i-01 uses professional-grade, gell-filled IDC connectors
rather than a screw terminal block for quicker installation without
wire stripping.

The PS-32 Master POTS Splitter is compatible with all ADSL and VDSL2 coding schemes

The Wilcom PS-32 VDSL2 POTS Splitter is a passive low-pass filter
designed to provide POTS service in concert with DSL technology. The
device blocks high frequency (20kHz - >30MHz) energy from interfering
with POTS equipment. The PS-32 employs a low-pass filter for standard
voice-grade lines.

The Wilcom PS-32 POTS Splitter is unique because of its convenient
mounting location inside the Network Interface Device (NID). The PS-32
is ideally suited for video over DSL applications such as IPTV (Internet
Protocol Television) over ADSL2+ or VDSL2. The PS-32 includes robust
ring-trip protection for non-zero cross ringers to eliminate video
artifacts due to pixelization.

The PS-32 is similar in size to a standard station protector and mounts
on the Telco side inside the Network Interface Device. The terminal
strip allows for easy installation so the installer can simply connect
the existing premise wiring to the PHONE terminals on the splitter,
and have POTS service up and running within minutes without expensive,
and time-consuming rewiring. ATU-R terminals connect directly to the
DSL equipment with existing cable. (Data-grade cabling is recommended
for new installations.)

Model PS-32i uses professional-grade, gell-filled IDC connectors
rather than a screw terminal block for quicker installation without
wire stripping.
