What is Chaotica?  Chaotica is a next-generation fractal art application,
designed for both novices and professional artists.

Novice users can enjoy editing randomised fractals to produce stunning
HD wallpapers and animations.

Professional users will particularly value the fast, modern rendering
engine. High quality animations and huge images for print are easily
produced, with real-time imaging controls that will dramatically
accelerate your workflow.
