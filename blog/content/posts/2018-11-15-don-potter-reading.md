  WORD MASTERY

<h4>Fresh Publication of an all time phonics classic</h4>

I am proud to announce the July 3, 2014 republication of Florence Akin's
1913 phonics classic, Word Mastery. I first published Word Mastery on my
website as a free ebook in PDF format back in 2004. The document got as
many as 30,000 hits per month back then. Many parents have emailed me
over the years to tell me that they used the method successfully with
their children, many of whom had previously struggled to learn to read.

  WHY NOAH WEBSTER’S WAY WAS THE RIGHT WAY By Geraldine E. Rodgers
</h3>

My coworkers and I are very thankful to Miss Rodgers for her years of
diligent research into the history and  pedagogy  of  reading  that
lead  her  to  the  just  conclusion  that Noah  Webster’s  Way  was
the  Right Way to teach fluent reading from the sounds. I recommend all
of her published works to researchers and teachers who are sincerely
searching for the way out of the dark labyrinth of illiteracy that has
descended upon our country.

I am happy to announce that I have just published Noah Webster’s 1908
Elementary Spelling Book with Create Space. The new edition is titled,
Noah Webster’s Spelling Book Method for Teaching Reading and Spelling.

  Reading Grade Level Tests and Diagnostic Phonics Tests
</h3>

There are a variety of tests you can use to determine reading grade
level. There are also some diagnostic tests to determine if phonics
training will be helpful.
<a href="https://www.thephonicspage.org/On%20Spelling/spellingtests.html" target="_blank">Spelling tests</a>
are on another page.

The Miller Word Identification Assessment (MWIA) is a diagnostic test
that measures the reading speed and accuracy of 2 different sets of
words--sight words and phonetically regular words that are not commonly
taught as sight words. If you have a slowdown of more than 10% on this
test, you should try our online spelling lessons. For a slowdown greater
than 15%, our phonics lessons are recommended. The MWIA is available from
Don Potter's Education Page. The MWIA is a very powerful test which you
can use to determine if you could benefit from phonics instruction. A much
shorter version has been developed and tested, it is the MWIA Version
3 It also has a short version of the original MWIA I called the MWIA
1 short. To help you understand the MWIA scores, 40L has developed a
document called Understanding and Using MWIA Scores. You can also watch
40L's YouTube MWIA playlist for more about the MWIA.
