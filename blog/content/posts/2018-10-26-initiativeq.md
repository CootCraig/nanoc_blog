<h4>Verification from Nathan</h4>

Craig Anderson,

Congratulations! Nathan verified your Initiative Q sign up. This means
you have completed registration and secured 10% of your potential Q grant!

You can help increase the Q network by registering your friends. You
can invite and verify up to 5 friends.

You may use this template, with YOUR invite link:

Initiative Q is building a new payment network and giving away significant
sums of their future currency to early adopters. Itâ€™s by invite only
and I have a limited number of invites. My personal invite link:

https://initiativeq.com/invite/HxvTS3ehQ

There is no limit on sending the link, but you can only verify 5 friends
in total.

Initiative Q will succeed only if many people join. The more people
invite their friends, the greater the likelihood of reaching the goal
of each Q being worth around one US dollar.

-Q team.
