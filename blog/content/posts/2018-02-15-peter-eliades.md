<h4>Cycle Theory</h4>

Included in the technical indicator area are long term weekly charts
of the Dow Industrial and Transportation Averages. The weeks on these
charts are numbered so that we can refer the subscriber to particular
cycles discussed in the letter. These charts are included at the end
of this section. Week 0 is the major Dow low of December 9-13, 1974.
There is also a long-term monthly chart of the Dow Industrials dating
back to their inception in 1897. This chart can be used as a reference
for long term market cycles.

<h4>The Cycle Indicator</h4>

<pre>
1.095 and above    Very high momentum signaling powerful and sustained market movement.
1.035 –1.080    High risk intermediate to long term top.
.995 – 1.034    Neutral – no important information given.
.980 - .995    Intermediate market bottom.
.925 – 965    Major market bottom capable of moving market to new all time market highs.
.910 and below    Major market bottom, but new all-time highs improbable on next advance.

Through our research on market cycles, we have devised an indicator to
measure one of the most helpful and accurate market cycles.

The Cycle Indicator very simply measures the average number of daily
advancing issues (up stocks) on the N.Y. Exchange over a 189 day (market
days) period. Taking holidays into consideration, the 189 market day
span most closely measures 39 weeks. That period is used because both
the 39 and 78 week cycles are paramount to our market analysis. When we
first started analyzing these figures, we discovered that periods of
low risk coinciding with market bottoms generally showed the some low
Cl readings. Conversely, periods of high risk coinciding with market
tops showed the some relatively high Cl readings.

The Cl readings were sufficient to measure the market over the few
years of our initial analysis. They worked so well that we become
fascinated with the idea of constructing a related indicator which
could be compared over any period of market history for which we had
advance-decline statistics.

We discovered in the middle to late 1970's that anytime the average
daily advances over a 39 week period declined to the vicinity of 680-710,
a market bottom was imminent. On the other hand, when the average daily
advances reached 750-760, a market top was in prospect. The problem with
the indicator arose from the fact that no comparisons could be made with
the other market periods for which we had the daily advance-decline
statistics. For example, in the early 1930's, a neutral day on the
N.Y. Exchange may have seen 170 advances and 170 declines. Obviously
the parameters given above of 680-710 average advances for a bottom and
750-760 averages advances for a top would have no significance when only
400 issues traded on the N.Y. Exchange.

For that reason, we devised the Neutral Cycle Indicator (NCI). It allows
us to calculate a ratio which, in turn, allows a comparison of any two
periods of market history. The NCI simply determines what a neutral day
(same number of advances and declines) would consist of in a given time
period. For example, on April 1, 1981, there were a total of 148,647
advancing issues over the previous 189 market days. Over that same period,
there were a total of 144,441 declining issues. If we divide 148,647 by
189, we get 786 as the average number of daily advances over that 39 week
period. Dividing 144,441 by 189 gives us 764 as the average number of
daily declines over the some period. We can now say simply that over that
39 week period, the average day showed 786 advances and 764 declines. We
can also say that on the average day over that period 1550 Issues (786
plus 764) changed in price i.e. advanced or declined. For purposes of our
research we ignore the issues remaining unchanged. The final conclusion
is also a simple one. Given the average number of issues changing price
each day of 1550, a neutral day (equal advances and declines) over that
period would be 775 advances - 775 declines (1550 divided by 2). 775
thus becomes our NCI or Neutral Cycle Indicator.

Thus, on the date of April 1, 1981, 786 was the Cl reading (average number
of daily advances), and 775 was the NCI (average number of daily advances
and declines on a neutral day). We can now form a ratio by dividing the
Cl by the NCI. The result is 1.014 (786 divided by 775). Because the
market moves cyclically, the ratio of the average number of advances
(Cl) to the average of both advances and declines (NCI) fluctuates above
and below the 1.000 mark. A ratio over 1.000 indicates a rising market
(i.e. more advances than a neutral day). Fewer advances than a neutral
day would, of course, give a result less than 1.000 and imply a declining
market over the prior 39 weeks. Because ratios are used, any period in
market history can be compared with any other period for which we have
advance decline data.

Although there is theoretically no limit to the number of points the Dow
Industrials or any other average can advance over a period of time, the
computer-generated ratios have taught us that there are general limits
to the swings of advances over declines (up market) and declines over
advances (down market) over a 39 week period. Once these limits are
reached, the market is bound to change direction. The purpose of the
Cl, NCI, and CI-NCI Ratio is to measure the swings and determine the
limits. It is not a short term measuring device, but an intermediate to
long-term one.
