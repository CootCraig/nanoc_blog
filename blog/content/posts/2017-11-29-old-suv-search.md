  Chevrolet K5 Blazer/GMC Jimmy.
</h2>

Production 	1969–1994

The K5 Blazer was the smallest full size SUV version of the Chevrolet C/K
family. Introduced to the Chevrolet line in 1969, the full-size Blazer
was replaced in 1995 by the Chevrolet Tahoe. In 1970, GMC introduced
its own model of the truck, called the Jimmy, which was discontinued
in 1991 and replaced by the GMC Yukon in 1993. Both were based on the
short wheelbase trucks and were available with either rear-wheel drive
or four-wheel drive.

Since 1981 (in the wake of the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo and the 1979 energy
crisis), Chevrolet and GMC used the smaller displacement 305s with a
9.2:1 compression ratio. These engines produced nearly as much torque as
the 350, giving a similar driving feel. However, these power plants were
underpowered and prone to detonation (engine knocking), especially with
the electronic spark control module. To achieve the 9.2:1 compression
ratio, the cylinder head chambers were smaller, measuring 56 cc instead
of 76 cc.

Beginning development in 1977[11] (before its predecessor was released
for sale) the 1980–1986 Bronco was designed to address many concerns
that held the 1978–1979 Bronco out of production. Nominally shorter
and lighter, the 1980 Bronco was designed to adopt a more efficient
powertrain while retaining its full-size dimensions.

In 1983, the Ford Bronco II made its debut; unrelated to the full-size
Bronco, the Bronco II was a compact SUV based on a shortened Ranger
pickup truck and sized similarly to the 1966–1977 Bronco.

<h4>Chassis</h4>

Again based on the Ford F-Series, the 1980–1986 Bronco is based upon
the Ford F-150 (1980–1986 seventh generation). Although based on an
all-new chassis, the Bronco retained its 104 in (2,642 mm) wheelbase. Both
transfer cases were replaced with a New Process 208 version.[12]

In front, the 1980–1986 Bronco is fitted with a Dana 44 front axle
with Ford TTB (Twin Traction Beam) independent front suspension.[12]
As with the 1978–1979 Bronco, the rear axle is a leaf-sprung Ford
9-inch axle.[12]

For the first time since 1977, the Bronco came with an inline-six
engine as standard; the 4.9L 300 I6 was available solely with a manual
transmission.

The 400 V8 was discontinued, with the 351M taking its place and the 302
V8 making its return as the base-equipment V8.[12] The 351 Windsor made
its debut in the Bronco as it replaced the 351M in 1982; gaining a 210
hp "high-output" version in 1984.[12][14] In 1985, the 5.0L V8 (302)
saw its carburetor replaced by a multiport electronic fuel-injection
system, rising to 190 hp (the standard 156 hp 5.8L V8 was discontinued
for 1986).[12]

For the 1987 model year, coinciding with the introduction of the
eighth-generation Ford F-Series, the Bronco was given a similar
update. While the shortened F-150 platform introduced in 1980 saw
changes, the 1987–1991 Bronco was given a number of updates to both
the exterior and interior. As it shared its front sheetmetal with the
F-150, in the interest of slightly better aerodynamics, the Bronco
gained its reshaped front bumper, flatter front grille, reshaped hood,
and composite headlamps. A change separate from aerodynamic improvements
was the adoption of rounded wheel openings in the fenders.

The interior was given redesigned front seats, door panels, dashboard
and controls (including a new steering wheel), and instrument panels.

In the interest of safety, rear-wheel anti-lock brakes (ABS) became
standard in 1987.[15]

For the first time, the Bronco was available with push-button control for
its four-wheel drive as an option starting in 1987.[15] The Bronco carried
over the 4.9L inline-six, 5.0L V8, and 5.8L "HO" V8 from 1986. In 1987,
the inline-six was given fuel injection, with the 5.8L HO gaining the
configuration in 1988.[15] For 1987, two Mazda-produced 5-speed manual
transmissions replaced the previous 4-speed (depending on engine); the C6
3-speed automatic was phased out in favor of the AOD 4-speed automatic
and the heavier-duty E4OD 4-speed automatic (the latter becoming the
sole automatic in 1991).[15]

Following the introduction of the ninth-generation Ford F-150, the Bronco
saw a major design update for the 1992 model year. Again based on the
same basic F-Series chassis introduced in 1980, the Bronco again saw
updates to the exterior and interior.
