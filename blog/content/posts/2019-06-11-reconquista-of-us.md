  Reconquista (Mexico)
</h3>

The Reconquista ("reconquest") is a term that is used (not exclusively)
to describe the vision by different individuals, groups, and/or nations
that the Southwestern United States should be politically or culturally
reconquered by Mexico. These opinions are often formed on the basis
that those territories had been claimed by Spain for centuries and
had been claimed by Mexico from 1821 until being ceded to the United
States in the Texas annexation (1845) and the Mexican Cession (1848),
as a consequence of the Mexican–American War.[1]

  Mexican–American War

Known in Mexico as the Intervención estadounidense en México (United States intervention in Mexico)

The Mexican–American War,[a] also known in the United States as the
Mexican War and in Mexico as the Intervención estadounidense en México
(United States intervention in Mexico),[b] was an armed conflict between
the United States and Mexico from 1846 to 1848. It followed in the wake
of the 1845 U.S. annexation of Texas, not formally recognized by the
Mexican government, disputing the Treaties of Velasco signed by Mexican
caudillo President/General Antonio López de Santa Anna after the Texas
Revolution a decade earlier. In 1845, newly elected U.S. President James
K. Polk, who saw the annexation of Texas as the first step towards a
further expansion of the United States,[5] sent troops to the disputed
area and a diplomatic mission to Mexico. After Mexican forces attacked
U.S. forces, Polk cited this in his request that Congress declare war.

U.S. forces quickly occupied the regional capital of Santa Fe de Nuevo
México along the upper Rio Grande and the Pacific coast province of
Alta California, and then moved south. Meanwhile, the Pacific Squadron
of the U.S. Navy blockaded the Pacific coast farther south in lower Baja
California Territory. The U.S. Army under Major General Winfield Scott
eventually captured Mexico City through stiff resistance, having marched
west from the port of Veracruz on the Gulf Coast, where the U.S. staged
its first ever major amphibious landing.

Father Maurice Gallagher, pastor of Sacred Heart Church in Avondale,
started Los Pobres 29 years ago. They currently have 5,000 families
registered at the center. Over 200 families come to get help each week.

Sister Nancy Crafton, of the Sisters of Charity, is in charge of Los
Pobres. She welcomed us when we arrived; and we were immediately struck
by her incredible energy and huge smile. A light seemed to shine forth
from Sister Nancy. Even though Sister Nancy regularly hears sad stories
(“This is not a happy place,” she said), she exuded a great sense of
faith and hope. Sister Nancy loves the people to whom she ministers. Each
person she spoke with was greeted with a smile.

Sister Nancy gave us a tour of Los Pobres, which is run by an
all-volunteer staff. Many local parishioners give generously of their
time, and all volunteers are farm workers themselves. Though the
Center is in a large warehouse, it is bright and welcoming. There is
a large clothing area for families to choose clothes which have been
donated. Another area is for distributing food. And there is a small
clinic, where local doctors come to help these men, women and children
who have no access to adequate health care, because they have no health
insurance.
