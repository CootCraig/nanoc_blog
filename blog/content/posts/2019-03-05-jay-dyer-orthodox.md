  Traditional philosophy and metaphysics Ep 6 - Aristotle, Simplicity, St John of Damascus & Defense of the Orthodox Faith BK I – Jay Dyer (Half) 
</h3>

Traditional philosophy and metaphysics Ep 6 picks up with a discussion
of Defense of the Orthodox Faith: we cover the first book, where the
doctrine of God is laid out, the essence – energy distinction, the
Father as the sole cause and arche of the Godhead, as well as touching
on the proper use of Aristotle (long before Aquinas) as we saw when we
covered his Fount of Knowledge, while book 2 we will cover for subscribers
