I'm puzzled by why Democrats are so exited by Hillary Clinton so I
went to hillaryclinton.com to find 7 of Hillary Clinton’s biggest
accomplishments, I'm still puzzled.

1. Fought for children and families for 40 years and counting.

   <i>
   Families and children are not extinct. Thank you Mrs. C.
   </i>

2. Helped provide millions of children with health care.

   <i>
   Therefore the U.S. healthcare industry is better than ever and no children
   go wanting?
   </i>

3. Helped get 9/11 first responders the health care they needed.

   <i>
   First responders got medical care. I wonder who the health care
   deniers were.
   </i>

4. Told the world that “women’s rights are human rights.”

   <i>
   Taught us that woman are of the human species. Good to know.
   </i>

5. Stood up for LGBT rights at home and abroad.

   <i>
   Standing is good. Where does she stand on gay rights in sharia
   governed countries and Muslim bakeries?
   </i>

6. Helped expand health care and family leave for military families.

   <i>
   V.A. system medical care problems have been fixed? Kudos Madam Senator/Secretary.
   </i>

7. Negotiated a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

   <i>
   Peace and stability in the middle east; mission accomplished?
   In an unrelated incident Mark Basseley Youssef's free speech rights
   are protected, although he is forced to plead guilty to probation
   violations; and sentenced to 1 year in prison and 4 years probation.
