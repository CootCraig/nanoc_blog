Our wood-fired Tubs emulate the features of a Japanese Ofuro.  They were
designed primarily for rural settings and have become welcome additions
at many remote cabins, lakeside retreats, and country homes.  These Tubs
allow their owners to enjoy a relaxing soak without pumps, plumbing,
or electricity; access to water, a little dry firewood, and the time to
enjoy the experience are all that’s required. These Tubs are heated
by a unique submersible wood stove; a concept that was developed at the
University of Alaska in the 1970’s and improved by our engineers over
the past several years. Our stoves have been designed to deliver maximum
heating efficiency while occupying a minimum amount of space in the tub.
