<h4>Making the Orton-Gillingham Method Accessible to Everyone</h4>

The Logic of English approach is based on the multi-sensory
Orton-Gillingham method, which has been used successfully in reading
remediation for over eighty years.

In the past, this material was available primarily in expensive training
courses and remedial learning centers. We want to make it available to
everyone! As research has demonstrated, when we teach using systematic
methods that answer their questions about English, almost all students
will be able to read proficiently.

At the heart of the Logic of English program are 74 phonograms and 31
spelling rules that logically explain 98% of English words. The Logic of
English makes systematic phonics easily accessible to parents and teachers
without expensive training or testing. In addition, Logic of English
curriculum uses the four learning pathways—auditory, kinesthetic,
visual, and speech—to provide a truly multi-sensory approach to
reading and spelling. Our lessons respect the gifts of all learners
while strengthening their areas of weakness. In addition, countless LOE
students and teachers tell us that learning in a multi-sensory way is
just plain fun!

  Logic of English Foundations Review By Marianne 8 Comments

  Foundations (Logic of English) Levels A-D 
</h3>

Foundations courses A through D comprise the beginning program within
the Logic of English’s language arts program.

While it can be used with children ages four through seven, Foundations
is probably ideal to begin at kindergarten level for most children. You
will generally use two or more courses per year. The publisher suggests
various sequences on their website, but the most common sequence will be
to complete two courses per year. That means you might complete levels
A and B in kindergarten and levels C and D in first grade. From there,
you can move into Logic of English Essentials.

Some might recognize the underlying Orton-Gillingham philosophy
for teaching language arts in Foundations. That approach recommends
teaching reading, writing, handwriting, and spelling together for mutual
reinforcement. Students learn all of the sounds for each phonogram at
the same time. That means that when the letter “a” is introduced,
students learn the three primary sounds the vowel is likely to make
rather than just the short-a sound as is taught in most programs. These
strategies are included in Foundations.

In addition, Foundations helps children learn the way sounds are formed by
the mouth, tongue, and voice box from the very beginning so that children
develop awareness of these sounds by listening for the sounds, feeling
how they are pronouncing them, and watching the teacher pronounce them.
