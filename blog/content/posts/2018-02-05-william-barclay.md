This NT commentary set is excellent and often recognized for it's
devotional value — if you can get past his poor theology.

What do I mean?

His grasp of history is phenomenal. His discussion of the background of
every NT passage is absolutely filled with interesting and applicable
information. His use of Greek is also excellent, yet judicious. There
is no need to know any Greek/Hebrew to understand his comments. Reading
this commentary can help to unlock the literal, historical, grammatical
meaning of the text.

However, his theology is - at best - inconsistent, and occasionally
downright heretical. You can read this review of his theology if you’re
interested.

BOTTOM LINE: this is an excellent historical-grammatical commentary;
just skip his theological comments.
