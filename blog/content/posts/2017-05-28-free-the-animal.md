Yep, you guessed it. You could skip the steps of extracting starch from potatoes and just use Bob’s Red Mill Potato Starch, but then you’d be missing out on all the fun.

Excellent article.

Rice, Uncle Bens parboiled rice.

Stay away from canned beans. Do them yourself the traditional way. Cover
with warm water and let them soak for 24 hours or more, up to 48 where
they even ferment; drain, rinse well and then cook in beef stock (add
water as necessary). The best beans nutritionally, as well as minimal
toxins such as lectins (the soaking process removes much of these too)
are: BLACK, LENTILS, PINTO. Red kidney beans are probably the worst. For
those, minimal only, like a bit on your salad when at a salad bar (but
load up on the garbanzos!). A great way to cook awesome pintos after
soaking, and in the pot: a sprinkle over the whole surface of real bacon
bits, garlic powder, desiccated onion flakes, and black pepper. Salt to
taste when they are done cooking.

The latest and probably most promising product I’ve found is unmodified (raw) potato starch (RPS). RPS is widely noted as containing 78% RS by weight. Bob’s Red Mill sells potato starch for under 15 bucks for 5 pounds. There may be other suppliers, if so, make sure you are buying ‘unmodified’ potato starch. Potato Starch is often modified for industrial purposes—you don’t want that!
</p>

<p>
Edibility-wise, potato starch is not bad. It mixes well with any liquid and has no real taste and is not gritty, mealy, or pastey. I’ve eaten up to 4TBS (48g), which is 30-35g of RS, on an empty stomach with no digestive problems. I think it is a very good addition to your arsenal of RS foods.
</p>

<p>
So, after months of research, it’s come down to this: I eat potatoes almost every day, cooked in a variety of ways, a few raw slices, and lots of cold potatoes. I eat sushi when I can, beans on rare occasion, and I keep a baggy full of dried plantains on the counter to snack on. When I buy bananas, I get the greenest ones I can find. Sushi is eaten guilt free, especialy with raw fish and seaweed. I will eat legumes from time to time if thoughtfully prepared to remove toxins. I also keep a container of potato starch on the counter and am finding all kinds of ways to use it–in smoothies, milk, kefir, mixed with water and eaten with berries and mashed bananas, or just mixed with water and drank.
</p>

<p>
In the several months I’ve been trying to get 20-60g/day RS, I have witnessed a lowering of fasting blood glucose from the 110-120 range to the 90’s, hdl cholesterol increased from 35 (in Nov 12) to 59 last week, ldl lowered from 150 to 130, and triglycerides went from 60 to 50. Whether these improvements are soley from the RS is hard to say, but at least they didn’t go in the other direction! It’s hard to pin down the contributions of a healthy gut, but I think it’s a worthwhile endeavor to target an increase in RS, especially for people who are pre-diabetic or have high cholesterol.
