  <a href="http://www.polyfacefarms.com/" target="_blank">Welcome to Polyface, Inc.</a>
</h2>

I am first and foremost a farmer, but not a very ordinary farmer. In
fact, I’m known as a Christian libertarian environmentalist capitalist
lunatic. Our family farm in Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley now has four
generations living on it. I’m second generation, but the day-to-day
operations are handled by my son. Polyface Farm is a diversified,
grass-based, beyond organic, direct marketing farm.

We produce salad bar beef, pigaerator pork, pastured poultry and eggs,
forage based rabbits, and forestry products. Purchased by my mom and
dad in 1961, the farm has gone from a worn out, gullied weedpatch that
couldn’t even pay a salary to one that employs 10 people with more than
a million dollars in sales. And it’s still experiencing exponential
growth. Lush pastures supported by ecstatic copulating earthworms testify
to the healing.

While many business folks would consider this a tiny business—and it
is—it is considered quite a large farm by USDA sales criteria, which
calls any farm with sales above $400,000 annually a large farm. Polyface
direct markets everything it produces to a customer base that numbers
2,000 families, 25 restaurants, and 10 retail outlets.

For context, please understand that we don’t do anything
conventionally. We haven’t bought a bag of chemical fertilizer in
half a century, never planted a seed, own no plow or disk or silo—we
call those bankruptcy tubes. We practice mob stocking herbivorous
solar conversion lignified carbon sequestration fertilization with the
cattle. The Eggmobiles follow them, mimicking egrets on the rhinos’
nose. The laying hens scratch through the dung, eat out the fly larvae,
scatter the nutrients into the soil, and give thousands of dollars
worth of eggs as a byproduct of pasture sanitation. Pastured broilers
in floorless pasture schooners move every day to a fresh paddock salad
bar. Pigs aerate compost and finish on acorns in forest glens. It’s all
a symbiotic, multi-speciated synergistic relationship-dense production
model that yields far more per acre than industrial models. And it’s
all aromatically and aesthetically romantic.

As we’ve gone from a single-salary, cute artisanal operation to a
multi-family, beyond family, multi-farm business, we’ve struggled to
maintain our quality of life and the distinctives that drive sales. And we
haven’t always done it well. I’ve seen way too many successful small
businesses gobbled up by deep pockets with shallow values. As a result of
wanting to stay with the soul of our business story, we’ve developed
a list of directives. These would be different for every business,
but let’s look at them and at least appreciate that they represent
innovative thinking in a western capitalistic business climate. I call
these ethics-based contrarian business ideas.
