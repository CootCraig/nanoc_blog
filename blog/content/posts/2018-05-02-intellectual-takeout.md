</h2>

Like you, we are deeply troubled by the growing divisions within
America. Discussions today quickly become heated, emotional yelling
matches that drive people further apart. Many of us even fear making
our opinions known, lest we be ostracized, threatened, fired, or even
physically assaulted.

How did the land of the free and home of the brave come to this? Frankly,
we see a couple of significant contributors: Breakdown of the education
system and the collapse of family and community.

Decades ago, parents could count on the local schools to train students
in logic and ensure that they would be historically and culturally
literate. No more. Meanwhile, the ongoing collapse of community, family,
and faith leaves a large and growing number of Americans feeling lost,
lonely, and adrift.

These changes, combined with smart phones and social media, have created
a perfect environment for propagandists preying upon emotions to drive
their agendas that threaten our very way of life.

While the times are indeed grave, there is hope. Every day the staff
of Intellectual Takeout come to work eager to help restore and improve
our great nation. We interact with millions of Americans each week,
publishing numerous articles each day and then promoting them through
vast social media and e-mail networks. Additionally, we host events,
publish a monthly newsletter, provide commentary for traditional media
shows, and give speeches to groups of all size.
