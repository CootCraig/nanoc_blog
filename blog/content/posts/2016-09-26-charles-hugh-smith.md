Why the Deep State Is Dumping Hillary - September 26, 2016 

In my view, the current era of U.S. history shares parallels with the
Roman era of A.D. 9 and beyond, when a planned expansionist invasion
of the Danube region in central Europe led to military defeats and
insurgencies that took years of patient warfighting and diplomacy
to quell.

  We Need a Social Economy, Not a Hyper-Financialized Economy - July 28, 2017 
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
Why is the community economy so important? The community economy is first and foremost the engine of social capital, which is the source of opportunity and widely distributed wealth. 
</p>
 ...
<p>
Corporations cannot replace communities for the simple reason each organization has different purposes and goals. The sole purpose and goal of a corporation is to expand capital and profits, for if it fails to do so, it falters and expires.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of a community is to preserve and protect a specific locale by nurturing social solidarity: the sense of sharing a purpose with others, of belonging to a community that is capable of concerted, collective action on the behalf of its members and its locale.
</p>

<p>
Political scientist Robert Putnam has described this structure as a web of horizontal social networks. Unlike corporations and the state, community economies are horizontal networks, i.e. networks of peers connected by overlapping memberships and interests. 
</p>

<p>
It is not accidental that the current system of hierarchical corporations, banks and the state increases inequality and erodes the community economy: the only possible output of low social capital is rising inequality.
</p>

To grasp the significance of these four characteristics, we have to
go back to the early history of modern capitalism. My longstanding
recommendation is to start with Fernand Braudel's 3-volume history,
Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century:

The Structures of Everyday Life (Volume 1)

The Wheels of Commerce (Volume 2)

The Perspective of the World (Volume 3)
