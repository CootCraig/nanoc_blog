## HD IXPE/XPE deck

### xpe foam

XLPE is chemically crosslinked PE foam. It is produced in continuous
rolls resulting  in a foam  product with uniform, closed cells and smooth
skins on both sides. It is light weight, flexible and soft to touch,
yet strong, tough,  resilient and resistant to moisture, many chemicals
and temperature extremes.

Compared with non-crosslinked polyethylene foam, it typically offers
superior thermal stability and insulating properties plus improved
dimensional consistency and stability over a wide range of fabrication
methods and end-user’s conditions.

XLPE foams are used as insulation and sound absorbing materials in a
host of container’s  designs.

It is easy to work in fabricating and thermoforming. XLPE foams are
right at home in the building and construction industry where thermal
insulation, moisture resistance, sound and vibration are critical. Indoor
or outdoor XLPE foams build success.

XLPE foams also used in backpack padding, luggage and similar application
are benefiting from a wide array of beautiful colors and variable
densities.


#### <a href="https://www.morevafoam.com/Categories/xpe-foam" target="_blank">morevafoam.com</a> Crosslinked Polyethylene Foam (XPE)

Crosslinked Polyethylene Foam (XPE) is chemically crosslinked PE foam
produced in continuous rolls resulting in a foam product with uniform,
closed cells and smooth skins both sides. It is lightweight, flexible and
soft to touch, yet strong, tough, resilient and resistant to moisture,
many chemicals and high temperature.

### eps foam

#### What is Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) foam?

The word Styrofoam™ is often used to describe expanded polystyrene
(EPS) foam; however, ‘Styrofoam’ is actually a trademarked term
for closed-cell extruded polystyrene foam made for thermal insulation
and craft applications. EPS foam is the correct term for any form of
expanded polystyrene.

Expanded Polystyrene insulation is a lightweight, rigid, closed cell
insulation. EPS is available in several compressive strengths to withstand
load and back-fill forces. This closed-cell structure provides minimal
water absorption and low vapor permanence.

EPS Epoxy Foam Core Surfboards… Are they the future?

EPS surfboards are glassed using epoxy resin and are lighter, stronger,
more buoyant, and have better heat resistant characteristics than
traditional boards.  I tend to destroy polyurethane surfboards but I
really like the flex pattern and feel under my feet.
