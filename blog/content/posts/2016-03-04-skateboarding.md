#### Tyler Hatzikian Deck with C7


<a href="http://shop.carverskateboards.com/collections/longboard/products/35-1-2-riddler-complete-skate" target="_blank">Hatzikian Riddler Complete Page</a>


Recommended with the C7 truck set for flowing single fin performance.

* 35 1/2” Long
* 9 7/8” Wide
* 20.75” Wheelbase

Designed with Tyler Hatzikian for the local hills and alleys of El
Segundo, the Riddler surfskate picks up on the interstitial space between
longboard trimming and highly maneuverable carving. The mid-sized deck
is long enough to move around on while still keeping the responsive
turning characteristics of the Riddler.

A great transitional size that will help longboarders practice cutbacks
and strengthen maneuvers on the wave, it features a single concave down
the length and a proper kick tail for pivot turns, acid drops and anything
else you can think of popping.

I've ridden both but own 2 pairs of CXs. I don't know if I agree with
everything he says in the video. You can't go wrong with either truck
but IMO: There is no real price difference anymore. C7s use to cost more
but now they both seem to cost the same or CXs are a bit more.

The CX pumps equally as well as the C7 once you know how to pump. C7
may have more sway and CX may have more snap but both pump equally well.

The C7 is heavier and probably not as good for tricks but it is better
for grinding as it has no kingpin clearance issues. I grind with the CX
with no real issues but I'm not a great grinder. If I was I'd flip the
kingpin or ride C7s.

CXs are lighter, require no real tuning and ride perfect out of the box
(once you loosen them to the 0 thread as they come cranked down to about
the 3rd thread).

Neither ride fakie well at all but I'm working hard at fakie riding on
the CXs and it is definitely more accessible once you swap the rear RS
washer to a flat washer and shorten your stance a bit. I'm actually
trying to do a little tech slide type stuff with CXs and Rainskates
hornets but its a slow process as the board has a lot of sway and lean.

Neil Carver recommended CXs to me when I asked him which I should buy.

I know Carver makes most of their boards without a front kick to simulate
that surf look/feel but IMO Carvers benefit greatly from a front kick
(blunt or normal) as it creates a nice foot stop for location or for
driving your front foot pump for quick speed and acceleration.

Gravity Brad Edwards Pro "Skull Beach" Skateboard Deck w/ Grip <a href="https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/decks/68501/gravity-brad-edwards-pro-skull-beach-skateboard-deck-w-grip" target="_blank">muirskate.com product page</a>

Description

Like the good man Brad Edwards says below, this board was designed by
a pro for all those that have dreamed to ride just like him.

You can think of it as an oversized street longboard skateboard, so I
guess you can call it a street longboard skateboard.

This board has a super functional round kicktail and a scooped nose with
a deep concave to help lock in the rider in while they are riding any
discipline their heart desires.

This board measures in at 40" long and 9" wide.  With this board you
can slide, hit up the park, dive into the pools, rip the ditches, mess
around on the banks, and even fly around slalom cones.

With this street longboard skateboard, we recommend setting it up with
some either Randal 150's for carving or Independent 169's for the pools,
ditches, and parks. For wheels we recommend setting up the Brad Edwards
with Abec 11 NOskoolZ.  Gravity's Description

"This deck is more an evolution than it is a longboard skateboard. It's
the board I've wanted my whole life but never had the capabilities or
freedom to manufacture. Thanks to Gravity's patience and liberal R&D,
It's finally here and better than I could explain in words. You just
have to ride one to understand. Parks, hills, ditches, pools, banks,
or cones it's truly an evolution." -Brad Edwards

I've been running green shield VXB's for a long time now... so I still
use speed rings and spacers. I buy the bearings by the box (100) so the
per set cost is dirt cheap.
