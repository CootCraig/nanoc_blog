<a href="http://www.westword.com/restaurants/denvers-five-best-vietnamese-restaurants-5762476" target="_blank">Denver's five best Vietnamese restaurants</a>

* Pho Duy, 945 South Federal Boulevard
* Pho 95, 1002 South Federal Boulevard 
* Ba Le Sandwich, 1044 South Federal Boulevard
* Saigon Bowl, 333 South Federal Boulevard
* New Saigon, 630 South Federal Boulevard

## Pho Duy, 945 South Federal Boulevard

The Denver area has dozens and dozens of pho shops, most of which serve
up decent bowls of noodle soup. But only a few really stand out, and
the one that rises to the top is Pho Duy, which is located in a strip
mall on Federal Boulevard. The menu is as spare as the decor. Save for
a few specialties and spring rolls, there's not much offered beyond
pho -- but the kitchen doesn't need to make anything else to pull in
crowds. Its intensely layered broth, which tastes like it comes from a
very well-seasoned pot, supports nests of springy noodles, thin slices
of beef, brisket or offal, and all the fresh herbal produce you can
stand. Ribbon it with sriracha or ask for a little of the restaurant's
homemade hot sauce for a punch of heat.

## Pho 95, 1002 South Federal Boulevard 

Pho 95 is another contender for the best pho-maker in town. We're suckers
for the brimming bowls of rich beef broth filled with tendon, tripe or
rare steak and noodles, sided by heaps of bean sprouts, cilantro and
saw-leaf herb. But we also love almost everything else on Pho 95's menu,
including bun (noodle bowls), spring rolls, egg rolls and a plate of
thin pork chops, coated in a sweet-savory marinade and grilled crispy.

## Ba Le Sandwich, 1044 South Federal Boulevard

There are a few places to get great banh mi sandwiches in town, but our
favorite is Ba Le, a tiny shop that turns out the city's best version,
packing crisp-crusted baguettes with pate, pickled carrots, jalape√±os
and cilantro, among other fillings. You'll have to take your sandwich
to go -- or perch on the planter outside to eat it -- but at less than
$5 each, this is lunch on the cheap.

## Saigon Bowl, 333 South Federal Boulevard

Saigon Bowl has held down its spot in the Far East Center for more than
fifteen years, but it would probably take a lifetime to eat your way
through its extensive menu. The kitchen cooks up a vast array of bun
and pho, but it also turns out stir-fried frog's legs, jellyfish salad,
lobster tail, a variety of simple and traditional fish preparations,
and our favorite Vietnamese fondue pot in town. Chinese specialties have
also snuck onto the list -- just as they have in many places in Vietnam --
to expand the authentic tastes of southeast Asia.

## New Saigon, 630 South Federal Boulevard

New Saigon, which I review this week, is one of the oldest Vietnamese
restaurants in Denver, and it's still one of the best. The kitchen serves
up a broad spectrum of dishes from Vietnam, one of the best countries
for eating in the entire world. A smart way to sample much of what New
Saigon has to offer is the rice-paper wrap platter, which holds all the
goods to make your own spring roll-style wraps out of soft-shell crab,
grilled shrimp, pork and egg rolls. But no matter what you order here,
you're sure to be pleased. That's what earned the spot our Best Vietnamese
Restaurant award in the Best of Denver 2011 -- and what makes it the
Vietnamese eatery to beat in the Best of Denver 2012, which hits the
streets on March 29.

## Sunny Gardens - 6460 East Yale Avenue 80222 - Denver

(303) 691-8830 | 6460 East Yale Avenue, Denver, CO 80222


## <a href="http://www.westword.com/restaurants/denvers-ten-best-chinese-restaurants-5773994" target="_blank">Denver's ten best Chinese restaurants</a>

### Spice China, 269 McCaslin Boulevard, Louisville

We spend a lot of hours searching out the most authentic representations
of Szechuan, Taiwanese and North Chinese specialties this city has
to offer, but there's also a special place in our hearts for the more
Americanized dishes. Louisville's Spice China definitely has a decent
list of more or less authentic Shanghai-based specialties, and it also
serves up some of the best Americanized Chinese food -- including kung
pao, mu shu and lo mein -- we've had in the area.

### King's Land Seafood Restaurant, 2200 West Alameda Avenue Alameda Square

is a good bet for Chinese food, not least because it's home to King's
Land Seafood restaurant, a joint that's been turning out a worthy array
of dim sum for more than a decade. During prime hours, trolleys roll
through the massive 300-seat spot, and the women pushing them plunk down
dumplings, porridges, stir-fried vegetables and hard-to-identify parts
of animals at each table. Just make sure you get there before 3 p.m.,
which is when the carts stop rolling.


### Zoe Ma Ma, 2010 10th Street, Boulder 

Edwin Zoe noticed a lack of real Chinese food in Boulder, so he imported
his Chinese mother from a coastal town in Shandong Province to make her
recipes and fill the gap. From a tiny space just off the Pearl Steet
Mall, Zoe Ma Ma turns out fantastic noodle dishes that span northern
Chinese and Szechuan specialties, delicious dumplings and zong zi,
bamboo-wrapped packets of rice, pork, mushrooms and lotus seed. And
while the regular menu contains satisfying staples, we're most enamored
of the daily specials, one of which is the fiery, rib-sticking Szechuan
braised-beef noodle soup.

### Super Star Asian, 2200 West Alameda Avenue 

A few months ago, Super Star Asian made the decision to expand, which will
double the number of seats in its Alameda Square dining room. Why? Because
the place was perpetually packed, thank to its ability to sate dim sum
aficionados with its massive selection of handmade dumplings as well as
please anyone after rarer Chinese delicacies, like shark's fin soup and
steamed chicken feet. There really is something for everyone on this
menu, and it might be the best restaurant in Denver to spot a chef on
his or her day off.

### Star Kitchen, 2917 West Mississippi Avenue 

We usually go to Star Kitchen for dim sum, and we're not the only ones. At
lunch time --especially on the weekends -- the restaurant is a chaotic
sea of people, with families huddled around tables, the adults passing
dishes back and forth on a lazy Susan while kids dart in and out of
aisles, bumping into staffers pushing carts loaded with steamers and
platters. And we can eat bun after bun and dumpling after dumpling until
we explode, one reason the place earned our Best Dim Sum designation
in Best of Denver 2011. But the restaurant also maintains a tome-like
menu of non-dim sum dishes, and the seafood specialties in particular
are worth your attention.

### China Jade, 12203 East Iliff Avenue, Aurora 

This Aurora strip mall spot has two menus. One features Americanized
Chinese dishes like egg rolls, lo mein and mediocre kung pao -- not a
single one of which is really worth a second glance. The other menu,
though, lists the good stuff: crispy pig intestines, tendon, thinly
sliced smoked pork belly and steamed buns. It's a vast offering of some
of the best Chinese-Chinese dishes, laced with garlic and ginger and heat.

### Lao Wang Noodle House, 945 South Federal Boulevard 

When Chung-Ming and Tse-Ming Wang moved to Colorado from Taiwan, they
brought their culinary specialties restaurant. And here in the Mile High
City, we're lucky enough to get a real taste of their former home, with
bowls of Taiwanese beef noodle soup loaded with five spice, pan-fried
pot stickers and pig's ear. Their xiao long bao -- or soup dumplings --
are worth the trip alone.

### JJ's Chinese Seafood, 2500 West Alameda Avenue 

Fish tanks flank the walls of this Alameda joint, from which the
kitchen plucks specimens -- like lobster -- to turn into dinner. And
to be sure, JJ's turns out some excellent seafood dishes, employing
jellyfish, razor clams, squid, shrimp and scallops, all specialties of
the Cantonese chef. But the massive menu at JJ's goes beyond ocean life,
too, covering everything from pedestrian sesame chicken to crispy pig's
intestine to duck tongue with basil in XO sauce.

### Tao Tao Noodle Bar, 10400 East 6th Avenue, Aurora 

Tao Tao resurrects many favorites from the Federal location of Chopsticks
China Bistro, which same owners David Lee and May Sung moved to the
suburbs before closing last year. American-Chinese staples such as
kung pao and Happy Family are supplemented by authentic Chinese-Chinese
dishes, including dim sum and a raft of platters featuring intestines,
jellyfish and tendon. The couple also took the opportunity to expand their
offerings, adding more specialties from Shanghai as well as a handful of
noodle dishes from their native Taiwan, listed in the breakfast section
alongside Chinese morning rice porridges and dumplings, even though
noodles are available all day. Don't miss the juicy pork dumplings here,
either.

### Chef Liu's Authentic Chinese Cuisine, 563 South Chambers Road, Aurora 

Chef Liu's is another spot with a "secret" menu, and it's one that
features specialties from all over China, including Beijing-style pork
with bean paste, fried pork livers and dan dan noodles. But truly, Chef
Liu's specialties are the Szechuan dishes, from mouth-numbing beef to
cumin-rubbed lamb to Szechuan chicken. The best way to approach dinner
here may be to have your server order you a feast of interesting items,
though everything that comes out of the kitchen is excellent. And that's
what earned the restaurant Best Chinese Restaurant in Best of Denver 2011.

### Hong Kong BBQ 1048 South Federal Boulevard

An honorable mention goes to Hong Kong BBQ, a spot at 1048 South Federal
Boulevard that serves up noodles, porridge and, yes, Hong Kong-style
barbecue dishes. It's a favorite of Cafe Society editor Lori Midson.



## <a href="http://www.westword.com/restaurants/twelve-best-thai-restaurants-in-denver-5742916" target="_blank">Twelve best Thai restaurants in Denver</a>

### Thai Flavor 1014 South Peoria Street 

At Thai Flavor, the curries are what shine, made by Surin Thanon, a
native of Chiang Mai in northern Thailand, and served in a no-frills
Aurora dining room. The star of the show is the panang curry--creamy
with coconut milk and laced with the heat of chili peppers, tempered
with fresh lime, garlic, and herbs, and dotted with tender cuts of meat.

### Thai Diamond Cafe 1560 Kipling Street 

Among a vast menu of hot curries and a host of other traditional Thai
plates, it's hard to go wrong. Complex, savory favorites like Pad
Thai are coveted by the loyal flocks that return to Thai Diamond Cafe,
along with comforting bowls of Tom Kha Gai, a hot and sour soup scented
with lemongrass, swimming with chicken, mushrooms, and lime leaves in
a delicate coconut broth.

### Thai Pot 1350 S Colorado Blvd #900, Denver, CO 80222

(303) 639-6200

This pint-sized Thai spot on Colorado Boulevard is about to move into some
new digs: In January 2014, Thai Pot will move a stone's throw away from
its current location, where patrons can still find aromatic Thai basil
chicken, shrimp red curry, and drunken noodles, in a range of heat levels.

### Snow Thai 406 East Colfax Avenue 

This Colfax newcomer has quickly been decorated with praise from
the Capitol Hill neighborhood, and although the owner is from Burma,
Snow Thai turns out healthy portions of Thai standards, like flavorful
Pad Thai and spiced curries. To top it off? every entree comes with a
freshly-made eggroll, on the house.

### Liang's Thai Food 16th and Tremont Street 

This friendly downtown cart serves up simple, authentic Thai food to
a snaking lunch line, and everything is made from scratch on Liang's
one burner. The expansive menu runs the gamut from Panang and massaman
curries to pad Thai, spicy sour soup and pad see ewe.

### J's Noodles Star Thai 945 South Federal Boulevard 

J's Noodles Star Thai crafts its dishes in a simple (and tiny) space
that seats no more than a handful of customers. Still, they come in for
traditional plates of larb, ground meat mixed in a spicy lemon dressing
with onions, cilantro, roasted rice powder and mint, and a legendary
pad Thai.

### US Thai Cafe 5228 West 25th Avenue 

US Thai is actually owned by a Laotian, and the cuisine tends to favor
northern Thai. The balanced offerings dreamed up in the open kitchen
include habit-forming curries and noodles, which if you're not careful,
can scorch your taste buds for your next few meals. Play it safe and
order the medium heat -- it will still make you sweat.

### Udom Thai 7547 South University Blvd. 

For staples like papaya salad, thom yum, and thom kha (plus chef
specialties like pork belly with broccoli and addictive mango sticky
race), Udom Thai is one of greater Denver's most coveted Thai spots,
especially for Littleton residents. But for those willing to venture
just a little bit further, it's worth the drive.

### Wild Ginger 399 West Littleton Boulevard 

Wild Ginger is one of a handful of global cuisine options in Littleton
and a comfortable place to train your palate in the tastes of Thai flavor:
an Americanized heat scale that ranges from mild to hot-hot is available
across the board in all dishes, like traditional noodles and curry. Kudos
to a more expansive selection of desserts.

### Star Thai 8048 West Jewell Avenue, Lakewood 

Yet another nondescript strip mall gem, customers swear by the bright,
complex green curry and plates of pad Thai, all customizable on the heat
scale. And although the space might feel questionable, the Thai dishes,
along with a small section of Chinese specialties influenced by one of
the native Chinese owners, make the place truly shine.

### Thai Monkey Club 102 South Broadway 4122 East Colfax Avenue 

To many, Thai food is associated with a sweat-inducing heat, and at
Thai Monkey Club they've made something of an endurance test out of this
association, offering a six-level heat index not intended for the faint
of heart. Whatever your poison, it can be cooled down with a refreshing
papaya salad or creamy Thai iced tea.

### Thai Street Food 11650 Montview Boulevard, Aurora 

Utumporn Killoran's works of food art made their mark on patrons when
she began turning out her dishes from a cart on the 16th Street Mall. A
few years and a move to a brick-and-mortar later, Killoran delights
with plates influenced from her home in the Issan region of Thailand,
from standby curries to the coveted noodle jelly salad, earning Thai
Street Food Westword's award for Best Thai Food this year.

### India's Castle 9555 East Arapahoe Road, Centennial 

Since 2005, India's Castle has offered authentic tastes of Punjab, a state in the northern region of India. Tapestries and cozy lighting make a comfortable setting as you feast on kormas, curries, flaky samosas and creamy saag. And as an added bonus on Fridays, you can experience India Castle's weekly belly-dancing night. 

### Azitra 535 Zang Street, Suite C, Broomfield 

Azitra, dubbed an "Indian culinary nirvana," is a departure from your
typical Indian restaurant in both design (modern and minimal) and
menu, which is divided into two categories: contemporary offerings and
traditional entrees. The contemporary offerings range from a tulsi-scented
salmon filet in spiced coconut creme to a masala-spiced rack of lamb;
goat curry, spiced vindaloo and steamed biryanis satisfy cravings for
old standbys.

### Yak & Yeti Restaurant & Brewpub 7803 Ralston Road, Arvada 

Yak & Yeti serves up perfectly-spiced Indian and Nepalese fare --
with the additional draw of award-winning beers, brewed in-house and
inspired by Indian flavors. Diners can enjoy a Himalayan IPA or Chai
Stout while cleaning a plate loaded at the all-you-can-eat buffet. That
spread is packed with carnivorous and vegetarian options, including
daal, paneer pakora, tandoori breads and meats, masala, vindaloo and
Tibetan thupka. For added atmosphere, it's all served in the oldest
house in Arvada.

### Namaste India 5545 Wadsworth Bypass, Arvada 

Two students from Nepal opened Namaste India in Arvada this year, adding
to the area's ethnic mix. The extensive menu includes homestyle favorites:
sauce-laden, lightly-spiced meats and curry, plus vindaloo, masala and
saag that will please almost any palate -- although our reviewer thought
the kitchen could be a little more adventurous.

### India's Best 1500 West Littleton Boulevard, Littleton 

India's Best, a family-run Indian joint opened by restaurant vet Hardial
Singh, turned a former strip-mall bar into a passage to India. The
atmosphere may be bare-bones, but the menu has everything you could
want, from clay-oven meats marinated in yogurt, garlic, and ginger,
to endless variations of curry, masala, korma and vindaloo. Don't miss
the lamb madras rubbed with hot spices, or the tender butter chicken.

### Masalaa 3140 South Parker Road, Aurora 

Masalaa has carved out a special spot for itself in the area's array of
Indian options: It's food of southern India, all vegetarian, and mostly
vegan and gluten-free -- but there's no compromising on flavor. The
sprawling menu has many interesting options, featuring a host of fresh
vegetables and a vast array of spices. The shabnam curry, for example,
mixes mushrooms and green peas, then cooks them with onions and a tomato
gravy tempered with curry leaves and red chili. A favorite spot.

### Bombay Bowl 575 Lincoln Street 

Bombay Bowl, the fast-casual Indian concept, was inspired by a need for
quality Indian food, fresh and cheap. The menu at Bombay Bowl caters to
vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike, offering bowls, plates and rolls
with your choice of tikka masala, saag, curry, channa masala or peeli
daal. Add spiced tofu, chicken or beef, plus naan, samosas or a creamy
mango lassi, and you have an exotic, healthy, inexpensive meal to go.

### Namaste 3355 South Wadsworth Boulevard, Lakewood 

If you're heading to Namaste, make sure you've emptied the rest of your
day. The vast menu, which ranges from traditional Indian to Tibetan,
has something for everyone, and the lunch buffet alone could keep you
occupied for hours. Food can be ordered as hot as you can handle.

### India's Restaurant 7400 East Hampden Avenue 

India's Restaurant has been turning out plates of authentic Indian
specialties for the last two decades, and continues to do it well. Expect
expertly-spiced curries, tandoori meats fresh from the charcoal-fired clay
oven, and a host of beautifully prepared vegetarian dishes, including
creamy dal makhani and spiced aloo gobi. The service is friendly and
efficient, and the setting is upscale and exotic. The winner of our Best
of Denver 2013 Best Indian Restaurant award -- and with good reason.
