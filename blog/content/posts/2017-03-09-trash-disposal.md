</h2>

C & C makes disposing of large items easy! As a part of our services, you
can call us to handle any bulk item removal need you have. Our qualified
staff is available daily to safely help you transport and dispose of a
variety of items that may be too large or too heavy for your standard
curbside trash service.

C & C Disposal uses our Transfer Station to accept many forms of large
item disposal. Our diverse service offerings allow us to be your one-stop
trash and recycling partner. In some cases, we may be able to arrange a
special pick-up along your standard trash route. For others, a special
appointment for pick up may be required.

Prefer to drop it off yourself? No problem! Items can be dropped off
during normal operating hours Monday thru Friday 7 am- 5 pm and Saturday
7 am â€“ 2 pm during Daylight Savings. On standard time, the Transfer
Station Saturday Hours change to 8 am- 1 pm. We have staff standing by
for additional pull-off assistance to help safely unload your items once
you arrive on-site.

C&C Disposal Transfer Station is a better alternative to the standard
landfill and is conveniently located off of Exit 104 just North of
Pueblo. The transfer station offers reasonable pricing and our courtesy
staff is available to answer any disposal inquires you have. By using
out transfer station your item can be recycled or disposed of depending
of its natural materials.
