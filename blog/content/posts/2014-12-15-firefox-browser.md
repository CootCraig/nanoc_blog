#### Navigation from the toolbar

The address bar shortcut should be as instinctual as breathing by now, but
there's a few more shortcuts to that top bar that you should keep in mind.

* Select location bar: Ctrl/Cmd+L or Alt+D
* Select search bar: Ctrl/Cmd+K
* Back: Backspace or Alt/Cmd+Left
* Forward: Alt/Option+Right or Shift+Backspace
* Change search engine: Ctrl/Cmd+Down (Next) +Up (Previous)

The link search is very useful, especially when used in conjunction
with...

#### Opening pages

Unless you do all of your browsing in one page, these shortcuts are huge
when you don't want to go running for your mouse.

* Open link in new window: Shift+Enter
* Open link in new tab: Ctrl/Cmd+Enter
* Open address/search in new tab: Alt/Option+Enter

Used together with their respective shortcuts (address and search bar
shortcuts and the find-as-you-type link shortcut), the page opening
shortcuts go a long way toward mouse-less browsing.

## Firefox with Pentadactyl

* [Pentadactyl is a free browser add-on for Firefox](http://5digits.org/pentadactyl/)
* [Pentadactyl Solarized Theme](https://github.com/claytron/pentadactyl-solarized)

Pentadactyl was once called Vimperator.

## Firefox with vimfx

* [vimfx addon for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimfx/)
* [vimfx on github](https://github.com/akhodakivskiy/VimFx)

### Why VimFx was created

Even before Vimium there was Vimperator for Firefox. In my opinion the
problem with Vimperator is that it has too many features and aggressively
changes the default Firefox appearance and behavior. Vimium was developed
for Google Chrome and it was exactly what I needed in terms of added
functionality. That's why I decided to develop similar extension for
Firefox.

VimFx will be nice to your browser and to your habits. Promise.
