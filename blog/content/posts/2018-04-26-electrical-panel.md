<h4>Different types of circuit breakers include:</h4>

<b>Single pole</b>, or 1 pole, circuit breakers provide 120 volts in
various amp ratings. Single pole circuit breakers rated 15 to 20 amps
are typically used for receptacles and lighting. They are available in 3
types: Full size (1-in. wide), half size (1/2-in. wide) and twin/tandem
(1-in. wide with 2 switches & controls 2 circuits).

<b>Double pole</b>, or 2 pole, circuit breakers provide 240 volts in
various amp ratings. Double pole circuit breakers are typically used
for appliances and hot water heaters.

<b>Arc fault circuit interrupters (AFCI)</b> are designed to shut down
power to a circuit when they detect arcs of electricity caused by worn
or damaged wires. AFCIs are used to protect circuits in bedrooms and
common areas. Combination arc fault circuit interrupters (CAFCI) protect
against against the same arcs covered by AFCI as well as low-energy
series arcing. They are becoming more common in homes as they protect
downstream branch circuit wiring and power cords.

<b>Ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCI)</b> break a circuit instantly
when a short is detected. They are used to protect circuits in wet areas
such as bathrooms, garages, unfinished basements and kitchens.
