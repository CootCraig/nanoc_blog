Greetings,

I've started working with OpenSCAD.  Certain frustrations with OpenSCAD
have me interested in ImplicitCAD and the Haskell API.  My workstation
is Debian Linux and I have just set out to install Haskell 8.0.1 and
try out the ImplicitCAD API. (Never used Haskell before)

My question for now is how I can stay in contact with you and others
working with ImplicitCAD?

I have started putting some library type OpenSCAD things on my github repo.

Thanks,
Craig Anderson
