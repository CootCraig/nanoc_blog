<h4>Bridging the gap between Sunday school and seminary</h4>

Ligonier Ministries exists to proclaim, teach, and defend the holiness
of God in all its fullness to as many people as possible. To that end,
Ligonier’s outreach today is manifold and worldwide. Having been
founded by Dr. R.C. Sproul in 1971, Ligonier’s teaching fellowship
consists of theologians, pastors, and scholars who teach through Renewing
Your Mind broadcasts, the Reformation Study Bible, Tabletalk magazine,
books through the Reformation Trust Publishing division, and hundreds
of teaching series. The ministry also offers an undergraduate degree
program through Reformation Bible College.
