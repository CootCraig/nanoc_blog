  Tire Tech: Measuring Tire Tread Depth with a Coin
</h4>

2/32" - Place a penny into several tread grooves across the tire.  If part of
Lincoln's head is always covered by the tread, you have more than 2/32"
of tread depth remaining.

4/32" - Place a quarter into several tread grooves across the tire.  If part of
Washington's head is always covered by the tread, you have more than 4/32"
of tread depth remaining.

6/32"  - Place a penny into several tread grooves across the tire.
If the top of the Lincoln Memorial is always covered by the tread,
you have more than 6/32" of tread depth remaining.
