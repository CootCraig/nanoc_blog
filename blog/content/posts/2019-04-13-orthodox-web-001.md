  The Life in Christ by Nicholas Cabasilas
</h3>

The Life in Christ by Nicholas Cabasilas is a remarkable product of
Byzantium's last great flowering of theology. At a time when secular
humanism was increasingly asserting man's complete autonomy, Cabasilas
proclaimed that man's true life lies not in himself, but in Christ. For
him, man's redemption in Jesus Christ is not just a matter of history,
which can be elucidated simply by scholarly endeavor. It is a saving
event in which man is called to participate here and now, in body and
spirit as well as intellect, through the sacramental life of the Church.

The present translation makes this devotional classic available for
the first time in English, while the extensive introduction by Boris
Bobrinskoy assesses its place within the history of eastern spirituality.

  Polycarp of Smyrna (born ~70 -- died (martyred) ~155 in Rome)   
</h3>

Polycarp, Greek bishop of Smyrna (modern Izmir, Turkey) was the leading
2nd-century figure in Roman Asia by virtue of his intermediary position
between the apostolic and patristic ages and his work during the initial
appearance of the fundamental theological literature of Christianity. A
Catholic Encyclopedia article is online at St. Polycarp.

His major writing, The Letter to the Philippians, is intimately connected
with the epistles and martyrdom of Ignatius. About 110 CE, while en route
to Rome where he suffered martyrdom, Ignatius passed through Smyrna and
was warmly greeted by the church and its bishop. Subsequently he was
taken by his guards to Philippi, where local Christian leaders visited
him. After his departure they wrote to Polycarp requesting him to send
them copies of the epistles that Ignatius had written to him and to
several churches in Asia Minor. This he did, adding a covering letter
of his own. In it Polycarp urges the reader to stand fast in the faith,
to avoid heretical teachings, to look to the examples of martyrdom
suffered by Ignatius and others, and to persevere in philanthropy and
good works. He concludes by saying that he is sending them copies of
the epistles of Ignatius as they requested, and asks them to send him
the latest news about Ignatius and his companions.

By his letter, and by his widespread moral authority, Polycarp combated
the Marcionites (from Rome) and frustrated their attempts to establish
Churches in Roman Asia. That sect advocated a rejection of the Hebraic Old
Testament deity for the New Testament God. He also struggled against the
Valentinian communities, esoteric Gnostic groups that claimed religious
salvation exclusively through their arcane spiritual knowledge. Polycarp's
anti-Gnostic thesis, an exemplary statement of post-apostolic theology,
refuted the sectarian argument that God's incarnation in Christ, his
death, and Resurrection were all imaginary phenomena of purely moral or
mythological significance.

Despite the proximity in time between Ignatius and Polycarp, as well
as the obvious affinity of their spirits in Christian fortitude,
one recognizes in Polycarp a temperament much less oriented to
ecclesiastical polity and possessing a much wider acquaintance with the
New Testament. Proportionate to the length of what they wrote, Polycarp
has two or three times more quotations and reminiscences from the New
Testament that does Ignatius. Of 112 Biblical reminiscences, about 100 are
from the New Testament with only a dozen from the Old Testament. Polycarp
does not refer to older Christian writings by name, but The Letter to
the Philippians has quotations (of approval) from these writings:

  Clement
</h3>

Starting in the 3rd and 4th century, tradition has identified him as
the Clement that Paul mentioned in Philippians 4:3, a fellow laborer
in Christ. The 2nd-century Shepherd of Hermas mentions a Clement whose
office it was to communicate with other churches; most likely, this is
a reference to Clement I.
