Written by well-known and popular theologians, Bible commentaries aid
in the study of Scripture by providing explanation and interpretation of
Biblical text. Whether you are just beginning to read Scripture or have
been studying the Bible daily, commentaries offer greater understanding
with background information on authorship, history, setting, and theme
of the Gospel. Verse by verse exposition of the New and Old Testament
can be found in commentary written by some of the greatest Christian
church leaders including John Calvin, Matthew Henry, Charles Spurgeon,
and C.I. Scofield.V
