<h4>Do the tools work on books from Kobo?</h4>

Alternatively, you may use the Obok calibre plugin to remove DRM from
Kobo books downloaded with the Kobo Desktop application (not the Windows
Store app) or on an attached E-Ink Kobo reader (but not a Kobo Arc or
Kobo Vox). If both are available, ebooks will be read from the attached
E-Ink Kobo reader. To import from the desktop application, unplug the
Kobo reader. See the Readme file inside the Obok_calibre_plugin folder
of the tools archive for further instructions.

Hot diggity dog, I have now used Calibre Companion to get a book from Calibre on my Linux workstation.

On the workstation: Calibre app -> [Connect/Share] Start Content Server
On the tablet Calibre Companion App -> Connect to Content Server. Select book to download.
On the tablet: Kobo App -> Import

I've just started reading ebooks and have purchased a number of kindle
books from Amazon.  I would like to "Download & transfer via USB" from my
Amazon account and then load into Calibre with the DeDRM tools installed.
When I select a purchased book I get a popup windows that shows:

..................
Download & transfer via USB

Select a device from the dropdown

Craig’s Fire TV
Craig’s Android Device
Craig’s Kindle Cloud Reader
Craig’s Kindle for PC

You have selected content that is not compatible with any of your registered devices. Please remove incompatible content from selection for eligible devices to appear.
..................

The devices are correct.  I would like to read the purchased books on
my Android tablet.

What is going on?

"Download and Transfer" is only available to owners of e-ink Kindle devices and Fire tablets (and DeDRM only works in the first case).

You will need to download books using the Kindle for PC software.
