Poldark: Finding A Hero by Lorie Byrd

If fantasy is your favorite, Game of Thrones has the immensely
popular hero Jon Snow, as well as the more unconventional hero, Tyrion
Lannister. Sure Tyrion likes to booze it up, and there was that nasty
business about killing his father, but his father was really super mean,
and for the most part, Tyrion is compassionate and kind and always aspires
to do the right thing.  He gets extra points for being really funny, too.

Horror fans can find a conventional hero in southern lawman Rick Grimes
or a more unlikely hero in badass, redneck Daryl Dixon, on The Walking
Dead.  Daryl, who eats squirrel and apparently isn’t a fan of shampoo,
isn’t the stereotypical hero, but he has the essential attributes —
especially bravery and loyalty.

My favorite hero of television today, though, by far, is Ross
Poldark. Poldark is a historical fiction series based on 12 novels written
by author Winston Graham over 70 years ago. The books were the basis of
a very successful British television series in the 1970s. They have been
recently reborn in a BBC One version featuring actor Aidan Turner.
