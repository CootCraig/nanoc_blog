  2015 Silverado Oil Catchcan setup using Conceptual Concepts by hunt4steve [OP] » Jan 21 2016, 12:59pm

I have remove the Conceptual Concepts from my Silverado. There was just
way too much oil getting past the filter. I've since upgraded to a better
filter: Elite Engineering

well, I've never heard from anybody concerning the CP HE or if this was
the 1st, 2nd or whatever iteration of this filter. Regardless, this is
a failure. Today I pulled the failure off and replaced it with a Elite
Engineering E2-X setup. This particular setup does not have a removable
cup to drain the fluid. Instead there is a 90 valve that allows quick and
easy draining of the nasty stuff. The bracket that came with the setup
is designed to mount the Catch Can off the Brake Master Cylinder. In my
humble opinion, this make getting to the tank valve difficult when it's
time to drain it. I decided to modify the bracket and mount it closer to
the front of the engine, next to one of the electric fans. This mounting
location makes is very easy to reach in and flip the drain valve. As well,
it keeps it out of the way should I want to upgrade with a second battery.
