<h4>In the Beginning: The Future Is Now</h4>


My name is Jeff Weiss. I am the owner and formulating chemist here at
Target Coatings. Many of my long time clients know the story about Target
Coatings, but most of you do not know the history, the big picture as
it were, of how my company, and its various brands, came to be. I hope
the following information will help to fill in the blanks about what
and whom Target Coatings is all about.

<h4>About Target Coatings: Water-Based Since 1988</h4>

Over the course of these many years I have come to know, in a very deep
and personal way, what the phrase, “the future is now” means. In
1988 I sat at my grandfather’s lab bench and pondered how I could
make a difference in both my early business career and in the lives
of my customers. Growing up in a family of manufacturing chemists and
small business owners I knew that making things was inherent—it just
felt right.  But how to be different and, at the same time, of value,
was the missing element. With this question placed before me I began to
research wood coatings and landed upon what was to become my life long
pursuit. I knew I had to do this in not just a unique way, but in a way
that few paint formulators had thought of and with materials that even
fewer knew how to work with. My family taught me that the history of
solvent-based manufacturing and its uses were littered with environmental
and workplace hazards. This unpleasant information opened up a world of
opportunity for me as my passions leaned towards environmental stewardship
and workplace safety. First, whether it was in 1988 or today, I would
not and will not expose others to a substance that I myself refuse to
be exposed to, be it in the lab or in the workplace.

Second, waterborne technology was still in its virgin state and the
opportunity to get into the water based finish arena looked ripe. So
for my own sake and for the sake of my co-workers, and ultimately, my
customers, I was driven to find a safer alternative to the dangerous
solvents and resins that we all had been working with since the early
1940’s. This was the goal that made me move forward. The development
of low VOC waterborne coatings struck a chord within me that resonates
strong to this day. I knew right away that waterborne technology “was
the future.”
