You will get a C2000a or C2000T modem I believe. Just use your router
as a AP not an extender and you will get better throughput. Thats a good
sign, most people have a hard time getting CL to do bonded. I think you
can do a three year contract for a reasonable amount.

I have pair bonded 40/5 on a residential account.

CenturyLink gave me a garbage Q2000 first, after several rounds and
escalations I was able to get a C2000T and it's been by far the best
dsl modem I've ever used.

Now as far as the process, you will need a new modem that accepts two
line inputs, also you will need two good pairs coming into one jack
(if your in a house this should not be a problem)

My lines sync up at 20/2.5Mbps per pair, and I regularly test and download
~37/4.7 and it's been rock solid for almost a year now. I'll never be
going back to cable after this connection

Also, you can put all the bonded modems in bridge mode no problem from
my experiences.
