Most Dave Gatton SidewinderCNC users will be using Mach3 or Mach4. If you
have software setup questions, please address them to the Xylotex Forum

4 Axis 40V 4.0A Drive Box with Four 4.0A 425 oz.in. Stepper motors.

Four Motor cables (about 6 feet long) are pre-installed and come out the
round hole in the back. The cables have Molex connectors which mate to
the connectors supplied on the motors.

* 1/16th step (microstep) for smooth, precise motion (1/8th available)
* Two Built-in Cooling Fans
* Easy connect for most popular Step/Direction control software such as Mach2/3/4, LinuxCNC or TurboCNC.
* These 425 oz.in. motors(.25 inch shafts, nema23 mounting holes) are better for 5 TPI screws and below, or Rack and Pinion or Direct Belt Drive systems. The available 269 oz.in. motors are better for 10 TPI screwsand above.

The higher voltage drive (40V) and higher amperage motors (4.0A) means
you can have a faster top end speed compared to lower voltage/amperage
drive/motor combinations.

Also comes with a 3 foot parallel port extension cable and IEC 110VAC Power Cord.

After unpacking the drive box, motors and cables, you can be ready to
spin motors in less than a minute*: Just plug-in the motors to the drive
box cables, connect the parallel port cable to the box and to a suitable
PC parallel port, and finally, plug in the AC power and turn on AC power
switch on the box.

assumes your PC software is already setup properly.
