#### Step 6

Place individual portions of rubbed ribs in vacuum bags. If using vacuum
bags, fold over the top while you add the ribs so that no rub or pork
juices get on the edge of the bag, which can weaken the seal.

#### Step 7

Add 4 drops (about 1/8th teaspoon / 1 ml) of liquid smoke to each bag.

For consistent results, I recommend using a scale to measure out the
ground beef for each burger. As noted above, thinner burgers do not
benefit much from sous-vide cooking techniques; you want thicker burgers
of six to eight ounces apiece in order to get the most benefit from
cooking them sous vide.

#### Rare burger.

With the precision cooker set to 120°F, your burger will come out a
nice red rare, with a very tender and juicy texture. For some folks,
rare burgers can be off-putting because of their softness.

#### Medium burger.

At 130°F, a burger comes out in the medium range. The texture is fully
firm to the center, with no mushy meat, and still plenty juicy. Medium
burgers do have a tendency to dry out as you get to the last few bites,
as moisture is pressed from them during eating.

<ul>
  <li>Very Rare to Rare 	115°F (46°C) to 123°F (51°C) 	40 minutes to 2 1/2 hours</li>
  <li>Medium-Rare 	124°F (51°C) to 129°F (54°C) 	40 minutes to 2 1/2 hours</li>
  <li>Medium 	130°F (54°C) to 137°F (58°C) 	40 minutes to 4 hours (2 1/2 hours max if under 130°F/54°C)</li>
  <li>Medium-Well 	138°F (59°C) to 144°F (62°C) 	40 minutes to 4 hours</li>
</ul>

A cast iron skillet is my favorite method for searing a burger. It allows
you to get a rich, deep char without overcooking by much at all. A burger
seared in cast iron also comes out juicier than a burger on the grill,
as it gets to baste in its own drippings.

#### Step 2: Weigh Burgers

Weigh out your ground beef into even piles of six to eight ounces apiece.

#### Step 3: Shape Burgers

Shape your burgers by gently tossing the meat between your hands until
it barely sticks together. Place it on a flat, clean surface, and gently
press the burger into shape using your fingertips. Do not overwork the
meat—press just until it sticks together.

#### Step 5: Season Burgers

Season generously.
Season the burgers generously on both sides with salt and pepper.

#### Step 6: Place in Zipper-Lock Bags

Bag the burger.
Place the burgers in individual zipper-lock bags and seal, leaving a one-inch opening in each bag.

#### Step 7: Seal Bags and Cook

Seal using the displacement method.
Seal the bags using the water displacement method: Remove as much air
as possible by hand, then slowly lower each bag into the water bath,
letting the force of the water press any excess air out through the
one-inch opening. Seal the bag just before it's fully submerged.

#### Step 8: Remove Burgers and Rest

Unbagging the burgers.
Remove the burgers from the bags and place them on a paper towel–lined
plate. Pat them dry very carefully on both sides and season with
additional salt and pepper. Let the burgers rest for at least 10 minutes
and up to half an hour.  Make a note of which side of the burgers is
facing up during resting—let's call this Side A. Side A will be dryer
than Side B and should be seared first for maximum browning and superior
appearance.

#### Step 9: Preheat Skillet and Add Rested Burgers

Before searing the burgers, have your toasted buns and condiments
ready. Preheat a cast iron or stainless steel skillet, coated with
one tablespoon of oil, over high heat until the oil starts to lightly
smoke. Add the burger patties, Side A facing down, and add one tablespoon
of unsalted butter. Butter contains milk solids that will blacken and
char, helping your burger achieve a dark crust much faster.

Cook the burger, swirling the butter in the pan to distribute it evenly,
until it's well browned on the first side, 45 seconds to a minute.

#### Step 10: Flip and Add Cheese

Flip the burger and add a slice of cheese to the top surface (if
desired). Cook until the second side is browned and the cheese is melted,
45 seconds to one minute longer.

## eggs

We cook a 57 g egg (extra large) at a high temperature (167 °F / 75 °C)
for a short amount of time (13 minutes), rather than at equilibrium
temp for longer, to create a firm egg white that's very similar to a
traditionally poached egg. We find that cooking the eggs at a lower temp
for longer leaves us with overly runny whites; not our preferred texture.
