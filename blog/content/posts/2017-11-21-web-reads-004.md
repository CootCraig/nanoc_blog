  Amazon Announces "AWS Secret" Service For The CIA, US Intelligence
</h3>

<h4>Announcing the New AWS Secret Region</h4>

We are pleased to announce the new AWS Secret Region. The AWS Secret
Region can operate workloads up to the Secret U.S. security classification
level. The AWS Secret Region is readily available to the U.S. Intelligence
Community (IC) through the IC’s Commercial Cloud Services (C2S)
contract with AWS. The AWS Secret Region also will be available to non-IC
U.S. Government customers with appropriate Secret-level network access
and their own contract vehicles for use of the AWS Secret Region. These
contract vehicles will not be part of the IC’s C2S contract.

With the launch of this new Secret Region, AWS becomes the first and
only commercial cloud provider to offer regions to serve government
workloads across the full range of data classifications, including
Unclassified, Sensitive, Secret, and Top Secret. By using the cloud,
the U.S. Government is better able to deliver necessary information and
data to mission stakeholders.

The Liquidity Pyramid Part I By James Cox
</h3>

The Liquidity Pyramid is a model created by John Exter (1910 – 2006) an
American economist, member of the Board of Governors of the United States
Federal Reserve System and founder of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

In the 1950’s he started to explain the economy in terms of an inverted
pyramid. The basic idea of the liquidity pyramid was to convey the concept
of how easily an asset could be bought or sold. In other words – how
liquid it is. At the top, he placed the most risky, least liquid assets
and at the bottom, the least risky, most liquid assets.
Here, it might be helpful to consider the idea of ‘wealth.’ We do not really own anything; merely we have claims to ‘things.’ ‘Wealth’ is a claim to or a command of resources (land, labour, capital) that have the potential to make life ‘better’.

<h4>The central banks’ goals, in general, are threefold:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Expand the money supply allowing for the further proliferation of debt, which has sadly become the lifeline of most developed economies.</li>
  <li>Drive financial asset prices higher to create a wealth effect. This myth is premised on the belief that higher financial asset prices result in greater economic growth as wealth is spread to the masses.
    <ul>
      <li>“And higher stock prices will boost consumer wealth and help increase confidence, which can also spur spending. Increased spending will lead to higher incomes and profits that, in a virtuous circle, will further support economic expansion.”– Ben Bernanke Editorial Washington Post 11/4/2010.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lastly, generate inflation, to help lessen the burden of debt.</li>
<ul>

The wealth effect is putting riches in the hands of a small minority
of the population, with negligible benefits, if any, flowing to the
majority of the population. Bernanke’s version of the virtuous circle,
as highlighted above, is far from virtuous unless you are in the upper
five to ten percent of households by wealth.  To understand how a real
economic virtuous circle works, we recommend you read our article The
Death of the Virtuous Cycle and watch The Animated Virtuous Cycle.

<h4>Consider a few of these facts below and whether they are sustainable:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>U.S. yields have been among the lowest ever on record dating back to 1776</li>
  <li>U.S. equity valuations have risen to levels rarely observed and from this perch have always been followed by massive losses</li>
  <li>Over $9 trillion in sovereign bonds yields in many European countries and Japan have negative current yields</li>
  <li>European junk-grade debt now trades at yields lower than U.S. Treasuries</li>
  <li>Veolia, a French BBB rated company, recently issued a 3-year bond at a yield of -.026%.</li>
  <li>Italian 3-year government bonds yield -0.337%, despite the 3rd highest debt to GDP ratio of all developed nations (132%)</li>
  <li>Argentina, which has defaulted 6 times in the past 100 years, issued a $2.75 billion 100-year bond paying a paltry 8% interest</li>
  <li>The BOJ owns over 75% of all Japanese ETFs</li>
  <li>The Swiss National Bank owns 19.2 million shares of Apple, or 3% of total shares outstanding, and $84 billion in aggregate of U.S. stocks</li>
</ul>

Yes, Ron, the central bankers have clearly crossed the line between
free markets and government controlled markets. To answer your question
about the “shakeout,” we must wait until the inevitable day comes
and asset prices are in free-fall. When this occurs, we will learn the
full extent of their support and how far they have crossed the line

Investors who strive to over-control, like the Yale students, are
doomed to failure, because they have committed themselves to a strategy
(performance chasing) that is empirically proven to limit returns. And
much research has shown that even perfect strategies experience large
drawdowns.

Indeed, our friends at Alpha Architect designed a “perfect portfolio.”
They “looked ahead” five years from portfolio formation and built
portfolios of large cap stocks poised to do the best. The performance
was amazing, but they also found something surprising, higher volatility
and similar drawdowns compared with the market as a whole.

  The Leveraged Economy BLOWS UP In 2018

<h4>The Fundamentals Point To The GREAT DELEVERAGING Of The Economy... Dead Ahead</h4>

While the mainstream media and financial networks suggest that THIS
TIME IS DIFFERENT for the markets.... it isn't.  The fundamentals of the
markets are so out-of-whack, I am amazed people can't see it.  This is
also true for the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market.  While a small group
of crypto-investors have made a killing, it's mostly digital wealth.
While I don't have a problem with someone making profits investing in
cryptocurrencies, I do have a problem when they believe this technology
is the wave of the future.  For some strange reason, they must believe
in the ENERGY TOOTH FAIRY.

While some of these cryptocurrency analysts (or supposed analysts) believe
that we are heading into a new high-tech world where we no longer have
to work, just live phat on our Billions in Bitcoin profits, the Falling
EROI - Energy Returned On Investment never sleeps.  That's correct;
it continues to erode our modern way of living each passing day.
Unfortunately, adding more technology does not solve our energy
predicament, it just makes it worse.

You see, frugality has been totally erased from Americans' mindset.
By being frugal, I am talking about being extremely wise and cautious
about spending ones fiat currency.  Being frugal is one of the most
important aspects of a successful household.  However, if frugality
were reintroduced to Americans, then the entire economy would collapse
overnight.  Why?  Because, the U.S. economic model is based on buying as
much as we can on debt and credit.  If we moved back to being frugal or
buying only with cash, then 95-98% of the U.S. economy would disintegrate.

What is quite interesting about the U.S. stock and retirement market
is that their values have skyrocketed while our energy consumption
has remained flat since 2000.  This wasn't the case from the 1950-2000
period.  As U.S. energy consumption increased, so did the value of the
stock market.  This was also true for world GDP:

<h4>When The Markets Crack, So Will The Price Of Oil... and with it, The Economy</h4>

If you have been reading my analysis on energy, you would understand that
oil is the KEY FACTOR to the health of our economy.  It doesn't matter
if we were to come up with some new energy technology like cold fusion or
thorium energy reactors, they don't solve our LIQUID ENERGY PREDICAMENT.
The world doesn't run on electricity; it runs on liquid oil.  If you
remember anything, that is one not to forget.

Regardless, I have looked over cold fusion and thorium reactors (along
with many other "silver-bullet" energy-saving technologies), and they
just don't work.  Yes, I would imagine some individuals will send me
information to the contrary, but the fact remains... our retail markets
are based on the just-in-time inventory system.  That system needs liquid
fuels to function, not electricity.  So, when liquid energy runs into
trouble, the world economy runs into trouble.
