I enjoy showing shop projects I have built involving; Machining,
Woodworking, Welding, Metalworking.  I am a retired Marine Engineer with
30 years of seagoing experience.  I am also a Airframe and Powerplant
FAA Certified Mechanic and Private Pilot.  I also enjoy Fly Tying and
Flyfishing, I have been flytying and flyfishing for over 45 years and
will show patterns that I have used and have developed, plus some great
fish photos and videos.  I will be posting (hopefully) educational
videos in all of these area's.  Please visit my shop and Subscribe,
Comment and Like.
