University of Oklahoma great books

One recent example at the University of Oklahoma illustrates this healthy
hunger. A course in the Great Books which was described by those teaching
it as “the hardest course you’ll ever take” has received “sky
high” enrollment as students rose to the challenge. Inspired by a
syllabus taught at the University of Michigan in 1941 by the British
poet, W. H. Auden, the course requires 6,000 pages of reading: Aeschylus,
Sophocles, Horace, Augustine, Dante, Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Pascal,
Racine, Blake, Goethe, Kierkegaard, Baudelaire, Ibsen, Dostoevsky,
Rimbaud, Henry Adams, Melville, Rilke, Kafka and T. S. Eliot. And that’s
not all. For good measure, the course also includes opera libretti from
Gluck, Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner, Bizet and Verdi.

Wilfred McClay, who designed the course based on Auden’s original
syllabus, was initially inspired to do so by the negative reaction to
the discovery of Auden’s syllabus in 2012. The universal response to
the demanding nature of Auden’s syllabus was that today’s students
could never survive such a course and would not tolerate the level of work
that it demands. Reacting to such negativity, Prof. McClay thought that
students might rise to the occasion if set the challenge. Prof. McClay and
the two colleagues working with him broke “every rule of the postmodern
academy” in designing the course, “creating a highly demanding
sequence of classic works, setting high expectations, and eschewing the
grayness of theory and the reductionism of identity politics in favor
of an intense engagement with the texts themselves.
