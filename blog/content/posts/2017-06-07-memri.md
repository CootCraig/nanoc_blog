  About MEMRI
</h1>

Exploring the Middle East and South Asia through their media, MEMRI
bridges the language gap between the West and the Middle East and South
Asia, providing timely translations of Arabic, Farsi, Urdu-Pashtu, Dari,
and Turkish media, as well as original analysis of political, ideological,
intellectual, social, cultural, and religious trends.

Founded in February 1998 to inform the debate over U.S. policy in the
Middle East, MEMRI is an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit, 501(c)3
organization. MEMRI's main office is located in Washington, DC, with
branch offices in various world capitals. MEMRI research is translated
into English, French, Polish, Japanese, Spanish and Hebrew.
