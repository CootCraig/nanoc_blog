  Review of Seiko 5 Sports Automatic - Model # SRP605K1
</h3>

The automatic movement inside the Seiko 5 Sports is the company’s
newer 4R36A (the ‘A’ simply means it’s the first generation of
this movement) which was introduced almost five years ago.  This 4R36
is a big step up from the venerable and ubiquitous 7S26 movement found
in so many Seiko 5 watches.  In addition to having 24 jewels, the 4R36
hacks and can be manually wound.  Finally!

First, find the arrow on the back and use a small screwdriver or knife
to pry open the back at that point. Replace battery and then replace
back wiht the arrow pointing to the middle of the band as orginially
found. Third, press the back on the left side and then use a rubber mallet
to strike the "raised" side down and it'll snap in place. Alternative
method -- use a cushioned screw clamp to compress the back.
