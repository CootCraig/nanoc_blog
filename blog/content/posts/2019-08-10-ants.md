  Maxforce FC Ant Bait Gel
</h3>

Maxforce FC Ant Bait Gel kills and controls a wide variety of household
ants, including Argentine Ants, Odorous House Ants, Little Black Ants,
Ghost Ants, Pavement Ants, and Cornfield Ants. Using Maxforce FC Ant
Biat Gel, you will start to see fewer ants in 3-5 days. The bait works
to not only kill the ants you see, but to ensure the entire colony
is eliminated. Ants will carry the bait back to the nest and destroy
the colony.

Maxforce Ant Bait Gel provides for the sugar feeding needs of ants. We
also highly recommended that a protein-based bait, such as Advance 375A
Ant Granular Bait, be used in conjunction with the gel bait. You should
always give ants a choice as they may be in the mood for either a protein
(granule) or a sugar (gel) bait.  Each box contains 4/ 27 gram tubes.

We provide 1 Plunger PER ORDER to expel the bait from the tubes. You can
purchase extra plungers or you can purchase a bait gun for use with this
product. We recommend using the Masterline Professional Bait Gun.

For complete ant control we would recommend a 2 part treatment plan. The
first is to apply both a sugar based bait like Maxforce FC Ant Bait
Gel along with a protein based bait like Advance 375A Select Ant
Bait Granules inside where ant activity is most prevelant. It is very
important to use protein and sugar baits because ants are moody eaters
and will forage after a specific nutrient based on what they are lacking
nutritionally. If you only use one or the other then bait acceptance may
take longer than normal because you would have to wait for their dietary
requirements to change. Secondly, we recommend performing an outdoor
perimeter treatment with a non repellant like Termidor. Chances are that
the ants in your house actually have their nest outside where they travel
back and forth for food and water. So, since they live outside, it makes
sense to control them there. Termidor SC can be applied above ground to
the exterior foundation walls of your house, creating a treated area of
protection for excellent ant control. Termidor is unique because ants
not directly exposed to the Termidor-treated area will be controlled as
they come into contact with affected ants. This Transfer Effect means
you'll see its effects on ants in one to three days, and most species
will be controlled within the first week following the treatment.

  Taurus SC Termiticide
</h3>

Taurus SC with 9.1% Fipronil (the same amount of a.i. as the popular
Termidor SC) provides best-in-class control of termites, ants and a wide
variety of other insect pests including spiders, roaches, ticks and
many more. It is labeled to treat for subterranean, arborel, drywood,
and dampwood termites.  Taurus SC is a non-repellent insecticide that
is undetectable to target pests, allowing them touch, ingest and spread
the insecticide throughout the entire colony. For termites, Taurus SC
will eliminate termite colonies in less than 90 days on average, and
ant infestations can be controlled in just a few weeks.
