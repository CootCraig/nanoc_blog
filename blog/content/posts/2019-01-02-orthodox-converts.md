  About Journey to Orthodoxy
</h2>

I am Fr. John A. Peck, pastor of All Saints of North America Orthodox
Church in Sun City, a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona, and an Orthodox priest
under the Patriarch of Constantinople.

The theme of this website is the Journey for those on the path to the
Orthodox faith. With the help of Fr. Hans Jacobse, and the support of
many like you, we continue our mission to reach out to the furthest
corners of our nation and our world with the Gospel of Jesus Christ,
and offer illumination on the path to His Church. It’s a well worn path.

  An Evangelical Missionary Smitten With Orthodoxy by Fr. David Hudson
</h3>

So in the summer of 1997, we took the plunge and started going to
the Divine Liturgy on Sunday mornings. Through Fr. Gordon Walker of
St. Ignatius Church in Franklin, Tennesee (whom we had met in 1995),
we became friends with American converts who had also come to Cluj as
missionaries. Craig and Victoria Goodwin introduced us to an Orthodox
daily devotional publication, DYNAMIS, a ministry of their home church,
St. George Cathedral in Wichita. Using DYNAMIS for our discipline of
daily Bible study, things began to fall into place; questions began to
be answered.

We also began to overcome our intimidation and to meet more priests
and lay people who impressed us with their truly Christian hearts and
lives. The Archbishop of Cluj, BARTOLOMEU, granted us his blessing to
begin translating DYNAMIS into Romanian and publishing it as a supplement
to the Archdiocesan monthly. Through all this, no one made any effort
to pressure us to convert, and even when we eventually requested to be
received into the Church through Chrismation, no one was in a hurry. By
that time, it was we who were impatient!
