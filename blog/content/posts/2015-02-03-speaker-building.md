The Little Driver That Could

I bought these little gems to use in a pair of enclosures from a
small JVC micro shelf system I found at Goodwill. The enclosures are
nicely finished wood, ported in the rear, and just needed a pair good
drivers. I decided on these Peerless 3 inchers based on good experience
with Peerless products in the past. They were slightly smaller than
the original drivers in the JVC system, but fit OK (see photo). The
result is a pair of satellite speakers that have a very flat frequency
response curve from around 100Hz to above 10kHz. Alone, they sound a
bit forward, and unforgiving of poorly recorded source material. But
add a subwoofer that crosses over between 150-200Hz or so, and they come
alive. Mellow jazz, piano, new age, and pop music (some of Paul Simon's
albums come to mind) sound really good through this system. Older LPs,
especially the large-scale soundtrack stuff (Exodus for example) sound
pretty compressed and unappealing. But then, part of this is because
these albums were pressed in the days of laid-back vacuum tube home
console "hi-fi" systems. Also, the Peerless drivers are very articulate
and don't hold back on reporting what's in the signal they're fed --
especially in the upper mids. Overall, I really like these little guys,
and plan to use them with a smaller powered sub in my family room. I
think they'd also be great in a home theater set up.


## Tang Band W8-1772 8"

### <a href="http://brinesacoustics.com/Pages/M18-T772/Main.html" target="_blank">Brines Acoustics M18-T772</a> Brines Acoustics M18-T772 - Tang Band W8-1772 Mass-Loaded TL

The M18-T772 is an outgrowth of the FT-2000. When the Tang Band W8-1772
appeared, it looked like a good candidate for a MLTL cabinet. Indeed,
it turns out that the W8-1772 is a drop-in replacement for the Fostex
FE207E. The W8-1772 costs twice as much as the FE207E, but is well worth
the price. It is more rubust driver, capable of more snap and presence
in the upper bass. It also has a much more extended top end and has no
need for a helper tweeter. I find this driver very satisfying for long
listening sessions with no fatique. Also, this is one full-range speaker
that can do justice to heavier rock genre.
