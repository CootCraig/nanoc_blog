# Desk height

### [notsitting.com - What is the proper height](http://notsitting.com/standing-desks/making-the-switch/proper-height/)

The height of your desk should generally be at elbow height. This means:
as your elbows are positioned at a 90 degree angle from the floor,
measure the distance from the floor to the bottom of your elbow. The
desk should be built to this height.

_This seems a little too high to me._

### [standupdesks.com - Measuring Tips](http://www.standupdesks.com/measuring-tips)

Most people find elbow height or an inch below elbow height feels best.

People using a laptop or keyboard might order a desk an inch lower to
accommodate the inch added by the keyboard.

_inch below below elbow, minus keyboard height sounds right_

* Elbow is 40" high
* keyboard is 1.5" high
* So 40 - (1.5 + 1.0) = 37.5"
