  DIY Dome Homes Built From AirCrete Are An Affordable & Eco-Friendly Option 
</h2>

DomeGaia’s AirCrete homes, which are the brainchild of Hajjar Gibran
(who happens to be the great-nephew of the poet Kahlil Gibran), are
made with a foamy mixture of cement and air bubbles, which create a
lightweight and low-cost building block that is fireproof, waterproof,
and serves to insulate the building. According to its creator, AirCrete
offers a number of desirable attributes for use as a building material
for single-storey residences, especially for the owner-builder, among
them the ability to cut construction costs “by a factor of 10” when
compared with conventional construction.
