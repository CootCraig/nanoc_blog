Colorado native bees include mason bees, leaf cutter bees, sweat bees,
squash bees, bumble bees, and are some of natures best pollinators. They
are found through out North America and the front range of Colorado. Leaf
cutter bees are used by farmers to pollinate alfalfa fields. Mason bees
are used in orchards for pollination services. These bees are also in
decline as well and providing habitat is as simple as drilling 5/16"
holes in old logs or lumber.

  Every Correct Thing You'll Need To Know About Mason Bees and Bee Condos For The Beginner
</h4>
Use wood whenever possible and never a non-breathable material such
as plastic. If you have longer channel lengths, you'll get a higher
percentage of female bees vs. males, up to a maximum of 11". Never utilize
a simple drilled hole in a block of wood unless you plan on inserting a
paper tube within your drilled holes. Round holes are best but a D-shaped
channel using a clear top viewing cover is a handy option for education
or research. Square dato'd channels work as do an open tray style but
it is less efficient for the females to lay eggs as they spend more time
laying down mud/clay.
