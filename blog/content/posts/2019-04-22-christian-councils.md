  First Council of Nicaea - 325 - first ecumenical council
</h3>

Council of Nicaea, also called First Council of Nicaea, (325), the first
ecumenical council of the Christian church, meeting in ancient Nicaea
(now İznik, Turkey). It was called by the emperor Constantine I, an
unbaptized catechumen, who presided over the opening session and took
part in the discussions. He hoped a general council of the church would
solve the problem created in the Eastern church by Arianism, a heresy
first proposed by Arius of Alexandria that affirmed that Christ is not
divine but a created being.

  Council of Constantinople - 381 - second ecumenical council
</h3>

Council of Constantinople, (381), the second ecumenical council of the
Christian church, summoned by the emperor Theodosius I and meeting
in Constantinople. Doctrinally, it adopted what became known to the
church as the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed (commonly referred to as
the Nicene Creed), which effectively affirmed and developed the creed
earlier promulgated at the Council of Nicaea in 325 (Creed of Nicaea). The
Nicene Creed, however, was probably not an intentional enlargement of the
Creed of Nicaea but rather an independent document based on a baptismal
creed already in existence. The Council of Constantinople also declared
finally the Trinitarian doctrine of the equality of the Holy Spirit with
the Father and the Son. Among the council’s canons was one giving the
bishop of Constantinople precedence of honour over all other bishops
except the bishop of Rome, “because Constantinople is the New Rome.”

Though only eastern bishops had been summoned (about 150 in all), the
Greeks claimed this council to be ecumenical. Pope Damasus I in Rome
appears to have accepted the creed but not the canons, at least not the
canon upon the precedence of Constantinople. (Rome indeed accepted the
precedence of Constantinople, next to Rome, only during the life of the
Latin Empire of Constantinople, created in the 13th century during the
Fourth Crusade.) In both East and West, nevertheless, the council came
to be regarded as ecumenical.

  Council of Chalcedon - 451 - fourth ecumenical council
</h3>

Council of Chalcedon, the fourth ecumenical council of the Christian
Church, held in Chalcedon (modern Kadiköy, Tur.) in 451. Convoked
by the emperor Marcian, it was attended by about 520 bishops or
their representatives and was the largest and best-documented of
the early councils. It approved the creed of Nicaea (325), the creed
of Constantinople (381; subsequently known as the Nicene Creed), two
letters of Cyril against Nestorius, which insisted on the unity of divine
and human persons in Christ, and the Tome of Pope Leo I confirming two
distinct natures in Christ and rejecting the Monophysite doctrine that
Christ had only one nature. The council then explained these doctrines
in its own confession of faith.
