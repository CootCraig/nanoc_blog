  How Do You Cook a Standing Rib Roast (Slow-Roast Method)

This recipe is adapted from an Alton Brown recipe that actually called
for using a terra cotta pot (?!) in the oven. What? Well, since I didn't
have a terra cotta pot to use, I improvised and used your basic foil and
it worked out great!  One useful tool when cooking a large roast like
this is a digital thermometer. This is a great way to keep a close eye
on the temperature without opening the oven door and letting the temp
drop each time.

This method is so simple and the end result is a perfectly cooked
rare to medium-rare roast with a crisp and tasty crust.  Place your
oven rack in the lower 1/3 of the oven, but not on the bottom notch.
You want the heat to circulate well.  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Allow the roast to stand at room temp for 1 hour before roasting.
Place the roast on a foil covered pan, with a rack if possible, to allow
for drainage.  Rub the beef with olive oil, then coat with kosher salt
and a thick layer of coarse ground black pepper.  Simple salt and pepper
make this roast delicious!

Insert a probe thermometer into the center of the roast, without
letting the tip touch the bone.  Cover with a sheet of heavy duty foil
and place the roast into the oven and cook to an internal temp of 120
degrees. (Note: The 9-pound roast took a bit over 3 hours to reach 120.)

When the roast reaches 120 degrees, remove from oven, keeping the roast
covered, and allow the temp to rise to 130 degrees.  (This will take about
10 minutes.)  While waiting for the temp to rise, increase the oven temp
to 475 degrees.  When the roast reaches 130 degrees, remove the foil and
place the roast back into the oven and bake about 10 minutes until the
desired crust has been achieved.  Remove roast from the oven and allow
to rest 5 - 10 minutes before slicing.

A great trick for slicing prime rib is to use an electric knife.  Place
the roast on a large cutting board.  Using the rib bones as a guide,
cut along the top of the bones to separate the roast from the bones.
Set the bones aside and slice the roast into individual servings.
