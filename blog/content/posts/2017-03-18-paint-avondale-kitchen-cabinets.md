  Pore Filling with Aqua Coat

The reviews on Aqua Coat are mixed but this is what works for me. This
is on a piece of ash. It's very important that you sand to 320 grit and
then spritz some water on the piece to raise the grain. After spritzing
you will notice that the wood becomes fuzzy. Sand the fuzz off with
320 grit. The seal the wood with de-waxed shellac. Again sand with
320 grit. Then use the method illustrated in the video for filling the
pores. Make sure to sand with 320 grit after pore filling. You may need
to repeat the process two or three times to get optimal results.

The search for the perfect waterborne cabinet paint is over!

In the search for a better cabinet grade waterborne finish, my company,
JHC, recently started using SW Kem Aqua Plus. Its rare that I get
excited about a new coating like this, but I am very pleased with
the results we have been getting with this paint. Kem Aqua Plus is
a waterborne pigmented lacquer finish system designed to be used for
interior furniture, cabinetry and architectural mill work.  It forms a
very hard durable finish suitable for frequent traffic use on woodwork
where a high performance coating is required and traditionally a solvent
borne coating is used.

Our experiences with Kem Aqua Plus started three months ago when our
Sherwin Williams rep suggested it for our cabinetry painting. This coating
has a learning curve that I would consider fairly high. It is a very thin
coating in comparison to the heavy bodied acrylics many contractors are
accustomed to. Sags and runs can occur, and application techniques may
need to be adjusted to achieve the desired finish. This is a spray only
coating so touch ups must be sprayed as well. Its quick cure to sand time
however makes repairs easy.  Air movement will dramatically improve dry
time, and you can sand any mistakes or blemishes and recoat in about an
hour when direct air flow from a fan is applied. Another advantage of
the quick cure time is odor control. You can feel comfortable spraying
this coating in an occupied home where air quality must always be a
concern. The smell dissipates very quickly, leaving only faint paint
odors remaining.

Insl-x Cabinet Coat

I found salvation on a gardening forum. “Ace cabinet paint or Insl-x
Cabinet Coat?,” someone queried in a 6-year-old post. Two products I
hadn’t considered among the many I had.

I zeroed in on the Insl-X. Made by Benjamin Moore, the acrylic-based paint
claims to yield a sleek, easy-to-achieve factory finish. There’s no need
to prime (heard that before) or apply a top coat (no fear of yellowing,
yes!). It’s durable and cleans up with soap and water.

Good enough for me. I was at the point where I would have applied nail
polish if the end result would be the spectacular cabinets I hoped for.

I found the paint at Saratoga Quality Hardware, a Benjamin Moore
distributor. It cost $52 a gallon. I had the stark white base tinted
just a touch to their popular dove white shade.

Well aware I was on the brink, my husband agreed we’d tackle the
re-renovation together. We sanded the chalk paint down to an even base,
wiped the cabinets with tack cloth and brushed away.

This product goes on smooth and dries quick. Real quick. Stall just a
bit midstroke and there will be streaks to contend with.

The paint leveled to a near-perfect satin-smooth finish. I could run my
nail across the color and no mark would remain. Because we used a brush,
and not a spray gun, there were variations here and there, but nothing
tear-inducing.
