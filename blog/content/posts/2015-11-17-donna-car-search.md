## S - First Generation

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_S_platform" target="_blank">Chrysler S platform</a>

The S platform was a modified variant of the Chrysler K platform and
underpinned the Dodge Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country and Plymouth
Voyager minivans. Chrysler manufactured the Generation I minivans,
internally codenamed T-115 during development from October 1983 until
1990.

## AS - Second Generation

Developed from 1985 to 1989, Generation II was introduced in 1990
and called AS. Design specifications were chosen in 1987 and were
evolutionary. This was the last K-based version of the S platform,
as the NS platform switched to a new cab forward design.

Models:

* 1991–1995 Chrysler Town & Country
* 1991–1995 Dodge Caravan/Grand Caravan
* 1991–1995 Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager

## NS - Third Generation

Generation III of the platform was developed from early 1990 to December
26, 1994, being introduced on January 4, 1995 and called NS. Its cab
forward design was defined by September 23, 1991 and inspired by the
1992 Chrysler EPIC concept minivan, designed in-house by Julie Dolan in
mid-1991. Final exterior designs were development program approved in May
1992 and frozen for scheduled late 1994 production that same month. The
first NS prototypes were built in November 1992 and presented on November
24, 1992 to Chrysler executive management. The 1992 "Reinventing Chrysler"
documentary, provided footage of the NS design process in the spring
of 1992.[1][2][3]

## RT - Fifth Generation

Generation V Chrysler minivan was introduced at the 2007 Detroit Auto Show
as a 2008 model, based on the new RT platform. It offers a new 4.0 L V6
as its top engine, mated to a six-speed automatic. The short-wheelbase
model was dropped, and, as a result, there is no longer a Dodge Caravan,
only the Grand Caravan. A version of the Chrysler Town & Country is
sold in Europe as the Lancia Voyager and several other export markets
as the Chrysler Grand Voyager. In Europe this version is equipped with
a standard 2.8 L 4-cyl turbodiesel engine (which is also standard on
the Chrysler Town & Country and Dodge Grand Caravan in the Philippines)
and six-speed automatic transmission. For 2011, all the previous engines
were dropped and replaced with Chrysler's new 3.6L Pentastar V6.
