Three-phase circuits are not designed for 115 volt single-phase use.
While about 115 volts can be obtained from a hot leg to ground, using this
circuitry is forbidden in electrical codes.  It is a dangerous practice.

There are three basic three-phase distribution systems in use today.
Small commercial buildings and some small industrial plants that have
about 50 percent of the electrical load as 120 volt single-phase will
have 208/120 volt, three-phase, four wire system.  See Figure 5.

There are three hot lines (A, B, and C) along with a neutral (N), which
is grounded.  Single-phase 120-volt loads are fed from line-to-neutral (C
to N, A to N, or B to N), and three-phase 208 volt by lines A, B, and C.

In the USA the most common configuration is 208 Y/120.  This indicates
that line to line (L-L) voltage is 208 Vac in a WYE configuration and
the line to neutral (L-N ) voltage is 120 Vac .  It is also sometimes
designated 120/208 Vac, 120/208 WYE, 208/120 WYE, 4 wire WYE or
120/208 Y.  See Figure 4.  Most Ametek supplies > 5 kW will operate on
this configuration.
