<h3>
  LS based GM small-block engine - 5.3L
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LS_based_GM_small-block_engine#5.3_L_2" target="_blank">wikipedia.org/wiki/LS_based_GM_small</a>
</h3>

The Generation IV 5.3L engines share all the improvements and refinements
found in other Generation IV engines. 8 versions of the Gen IV 5.3L
engine were produced: 3 iron blocks (LY5, LMG, and LMF) and 5 aluminum
blocks (LH6, LH8, LH9, LC9, and LS4). All versions featured Active Fuel
Management except for the LH8, LH9 and LMF.

The Vortec 5300, or LM7/L59/LM4, is a V8 truck engine. It is a
longer-stroked (by 9 mm (0.35 in)) version of the Vortec 4800 and replaced
the L31. L59 denoted a flexible fuel version of the standard fuel LM7
engine. Displacement is 5.3 L (5,328 cc (325.1 cu in)) from 3.78-inch
(96 mm) bore and 3.622-inch (92.0 mm) stroke. Vortec 5300s are built in
St. Catharines, Ontario and Romulus, Michigan. Another engine variant,
the L33, shares the same displacement, but has an aluminum block with
cast in cylinder liners, much like the LS1.

<h4>LMG</h4>

The Vortec 5300 LMG (VIN code "0") is the flexible-fuel version of the
LY5. Power and torque ratings for SUV and pickup truck applications are
the same as each application's LY5 rating. Variable valve timing was
added for the 2010 model year.

Depending on your needs:

2004 is the first year they came out with the double cab and changed
the front brakes to the larger 13WL calipers/pads to help prevent rotors
from warping

2005-2006 are the only years that came with VVT-i with the 2uz engine
as well as a 5 speed auto instead of a 4 speed.

Other than that pretty much all the changes they made to the first gens
were cosmetic.

2007 was the first year of the second gens.

<h1>Vortec 4.8L V8</h1>

<h3>
  Vortec 4800 LY2 (VIN code "C") is a Generation IV small block V8 truck engine
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LS_based_GM_small-block_engine#4.8_L" target="_blank">wikipedia.org/wiki/LS_based_GM</a>
</h3>

The Vortec 4800 LY2 (VIN code "C") is a Generation IV small block V8 truck
engine. Like its LR4 predecessor, it gets its displacement from a 96.01 mm
(3.780 in) bore and 83 mm (3.268 in) stroke. The smallest member of the
Generation IV engine family, it is unique in that it is the only member
of that family that is used in trucks that <b>does not feature variable
valve timing</b>. It has a <b>cast iron block</b>. Power output is 260–295 hp
(194–220 kW) and torque is 295–305 lb⋅ft (400–414 N⋅m).

LY2 applications:

<pre>
2008–2009 Chevrolet Express/GMC Savana
2007–2009 Chevrolet Silverado
2007–2009 Chevrolet Tahoe
2007–2009 GMC Sierra
2007–2009 GMC Yukon
