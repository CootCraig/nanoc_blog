PyCAM is a toolpath generator for 3-axis CNC machining. It loads 3D
models in STL format or 2D contour models from DXF or SVG files. The
resulting GCode can be used with EMC2 or any other machine controller.

PyCAM supports a wide range of toolpath strategies for 3D models and 2D
contour models.

## <a href="https://vimeo.com/18254871" target="_blank">PyCAM #1: Generating a toolpath for a 2D model</a>

The video shows how to generate a toolpath based on a 2D contour model
(SVG). The following steps are described:

1. define a tool shape
2. configure an engraving process
3. set a bounding box
4. add support bridges
5. simulate the generated toolpath
6. store the resulting toolpath as a GCode file

Everything was done with PyCAM v0.5 (pycam.sf.net) - an open source
toolpath generator for 3 axes machines.

BEWARE: due to a recent change in PyCAM you need to specify the "upper
z margin" instead of the "lower z margin" (as described in the video).

from Lars Kruse

The video shows how to use multi-layered 2D models with
the toolpath generator PyCAM. The following steps are described:

1. create a multi-layered 2D model with Inkscape
1. use the clipboard for copy/paste operations
1. verify the polygon winding in a 2D model
1. fix the polygon winding
1. use pocketing
1. simulate the generated toolpath
1. store the resulting toolpath as a GCode file

Everything was done with PyCAM v0.5 (pycam.sf.net) - an open source
toolpath generator for 3 axes machines.
