Headlight Restoration Kit DIY how to Restore Yellowed, Dull, Cloudy, Oxidized Polycarbonate, Plexiglass, PVC in 60 seconds by hand (no machine 100%)
<a href="http://www.autogeekonline.net/forum/show-n-shine/92990-headlight-restoration-kit-diy-how-restore-yellowed-dull-cloudy-oxidized-polycarbonate-plexiglass-pvc-60-seconds-hand-no-machine-100-a.html" target="_blank">autogeekonline forum thread</a>

This technique takes 1 minute to restore most headlights or to be more
precise 90% of cars & motorcycle plastics can be polished like this, the
exception is very, very neglected headlamps, windshields, helmet visors,
cabriolet plastic windows, PVC etc. where same technique & chemicals are
needed only with the help of machine (drill) & pads/polishing balls. To
make it even more complicated the next level is use of wet sanding with
800 & 1500 (2000, 2500 if you want to shorten polishing time by machine)
grit sandpaper & to get confused completely you'll like to finish with
2K clear coat spray...but I repeat, 90% of mentioned above plastics can
be restored in 1 minute by hand.

This is what I have achieved using this technique & your results will
be the same if not better, 2 minutes is always better than 1 & 3,4,5 is
even better but 1 minute is the benchmark, the deviation varies (work +
time) = but results will be almost the same, because what first polishing
step does is about the maximum result.

To restore your exterior (interior ex. speedometer in cars & motorbikes)
clear plastics you'll need:

* Polishing compound (Intensive Abrasive Index Polish)
* Wax or Sealant/Glaze, Finish Polish
* Microfiber(s)
* Right or Left hand

As you see I don't mention the brands as this is totally unimportant,
the best 1st step product will be something that sounds like: polish,
polishing compound, swirl remover, scratch remover also something with the
name like metal polish is excellent 1st step to polish your headlights.

The 2nd step is needed (but not required) only to better clean the polish
residue on the clear plastics, to give more clarity, shine & protection
against further deterioration in the future as wax or sealant protects
better than polishing compound for example.

When you see that your headlights are not so clear again as when you
first polished it last time, just take microfiber & wax it, it will look
wonderful again & polishing will not be required.

So polish + microfiber & you start to clean your car/motorbike lenses
using moderate to high pressure, then without removing the polish you
just applied, squeeze some wax on the microfiber (same microfiber or new
one doesn't matter) & start to clean lenses (any clear exterior/interior
plastics in boats, cars, air planes & motorbikes) to a perfect clarity.

Now if you think I am joking, I am not. Here are 1 minute results &
if you will use this simple technique & will be happy or unhappy about
the results, just post your pictures here, I'll be happy to see your
compliments & even more complaints.

#### Mike58: Are you saying the polish you use is heavy duty like m105?

Exactly Meguiars M105, this is 1st step then wax, sealant or finish.

But polishing compound that comes in metal or plastic tins & looks like
a paste is the best from my experience, it cleans the lenses faster. M105
is not so liquid & is more like a paste so must be OK.

This method is preferred to wet sanding & even 2K clear coat spray
as a finish, because plastics that deteriorate after years, their
hardness (polycarbonate hardness is Rockwell M70 & as a funny comparison
Fluoropolymer which is used in many PTFE & Teflon polishes & waxes & is
considered a very good weather UVA/UVB protection is M30 which means good
for a liquid substance) & UVA/UVB resistance is broken not only from the
outside where they are clear coated at the factory but all their structure
is weakened from the inside, so after much effort the yellowing will come
back & then you can't just polish & wax it in 1 minute, you'll need again
to wet sand it & make all the process from the beginning which takes few
hours, I think it's better just to wax it after they become yellow again,
1 minute is not so much to do it even once a month.

In my opinion clear coat is only 30% harder than polycarbonate (on
this scale would be like M90 maximum) & when applying such coatings
on the lenses some of it are UVA treated with a lamp but again, most
modern waxes & sealants also offer this kind of weather resistance,
weaker than clear coat but when plastic is broken from the inside,
so wet sanding, hours of work & you only protect in the end to outer
surface with clear coat, but because plastic is broken from the inside,
sun & weather will just pass through clear coat without harming it but
will harm the plastic below it & this will harm clear coat back side
that sits on the broken plastic & then anyway clear coat will break.

Also keep in mind that clear coat if not of the highest quality will
make your headlights look more dark, not so clear & even grey.

So all the pros & cons leave us with 1 question in the end: Hours of
hard work or 1 minute?

Here everybody decides for him/her self.

Rob4092xx:
Can someone please interpret for me so I understand this one minute process? Thanks!

Don't ask, practice & experience will lead you to success.

You can't win a Jackpot without filling a lottery ticket first.

For my patented PolyCarboPlexiPlast System™ you will have to buy
Polishing Compound, Wax, Microfiber.

When you approach not looking as new headlight, you take a polishing
compound (also products that's written on the bottle scratch remover,
swirl remover & even metal polish work as good on any plastic headlights)
on a microfiber & start to polish a headlight by hand with medium to hard
pressure in circular or left-right motion, up & down it doesn't matter the
movements, then next without wiping out the polishing compound left on
the headlight, you apply to the same or new microfiber wax or sealant &
start to apply it the same as 1st stem. Finally you wipe it all out with
the dry microfiber side or new microfiber.

Hocus Pocus headlights will look as new again in most cases (in 90%
of headlights), then only wax it once a month or so to keep a perfect
look always.

If you still don't understand, then my system is not for you.


You are 100% right, the best nano polymer/carnauba paint sealants offer
between 6-12 months of paint shine & protection, that's why 34-55$ per
headlights restoration & no problem, people are happy, for the same
work in authorized car garages (motorcycles don't do it, they simply
sell new bike headlights, windshields etc.) people pay them 100-150$ &
garages use only cheapest out of date products while I use the best.

When I started doing it I used headlight restoration kits, it's all BS &
expensive, my cost is 1 cent per headlight, 1 minute work plus 12 months
warranty if in case they don't pass the technical inspection next work
is free no questions asked or your money back, in 2Y nobody called me
back complaining (every customer gets air freshener(S) to feel good when
leaving after 1 minute, my business card so they know where to find me
I am not hiding), on the opposite people (I don't even know their names)
forward their friends.

In the summer about 90 cars/bikes per month, in the winter when darkness
comes earlier up to 140 so I have seen a lot of headlights, even coated,
believe me coated & cured hold about the same but they look ugly, grey,
matte...nothing will make headlights quality as new from the manufacturer,
all plastic breaks through inside/out because when headlights are not
clear, bulb heat grows & this burns the plastic from the inside because
exit light from the reflector doesn't go through clear, headlights are
no more 100% hermetic, that's it.

I don't go so deep into peoples lives BS them with wet sanding, 2K
clear coating, curing in the sun & they don't even ask or want it (I
charge 400$ for such work) White Pearl Lexus LS 460 Nano Polish&Wax +
Headlights Restoration by Sharkpolitur , Israelis are easy go society,
they pass the test & 2Y prove my system works very good for them so is
for me. This is what counts here.

Another micro detailing strategy I offer in the winter to the people
that I don't know them is windshield rain repellent coating, charge the
same as for headlights restoration, front window 34$ all 55$, the only
difference is that it takes not 1 minute but 5 minutes.

I buy such Waterslide Rain Repellent Coating (note that on the bottle
there is grammar mistake, they write Repellant not Repellent & instead
Visibility=Visability, I think this is some Chicago slang as the products
are Made in USA).

1 bottle cost me 5$ & will do minimum 10 max. 30 car windows (depends
how greedy you are, for me about 10 front windows as product just goes &
goes even 1 drop makes a lot of application, I apply 2 coats), so expenses
are really none.

I know this is very confusing such coatings but I have tried 4 different
brands from Germany, Belgium, UK, USA all are the same, all hold for
months neither wipers or car washes don't damage the slide of the rain
drops. All work so brand doesn't matter, I speak for myself only.

This is some internet pics from some brands regarding anti rain coating,
my works just the same, look for yourself.


Above pics I took from the internet from top brand names, you all know
some & use some, as you see water drops don't connect under the same
angle as not coated glass, also when big amount of water in such tests
runs from the top down, you see how coated glass breaks the water flow
into small rivers while not coated is just one big water spot. Well,
basically that's it. Below are real life pics.

If you look for extra income, my headlight restoration 1 minute system &
rain repellent coating can be offered as stand alone service to all the
strangers out there. Good luck.

Clean glass very good first, apply the glass coating with very soft
applicator (something that doesn't suck the liquid but spreads it), wait
1 minute & as it evaporates wipe it away (you can also wait 1 minute &
apply 2nd coat, then wipe away).

I offer all winter warranty (winter in Israel is few months of rains
here & there), in 2Y nobody called back said it doesn't work or asked
to reapply it. It works.

### Method?

1st step product like: polish, polishing compound, swirl remover, scratch remover 

also name like metal polish is excellent 1st step

Exactly Meguiars M105, this is 1st step then wax, sealant or finish.

But polishing compound that comes in metal or plastic tins & looks like
a paste is the best from my experience, it cleans the lenses faster. M105
is not so liquid & is more like a paste so must be OK.

I came myself to now the best for me system:
Polishing Compound & Wax or Sealant.

take a polishing compound
(also products that's written on the bottle scratch remover,
swirl remover 
& even metal polish work as good on any plastic headlights)

on a microfiber & 

start to polish a headlight by hand with medium to hard
pressure in circular or left-right motion, up & down it doesn't matter the
movements, 

then next without wiping out the polishing compound left on the headlight

you apply to the same or new microfiber wax or sealant &
start to apply it the same as 1st stem. 

Finally you wipe it all out with
the dry microfiber side or new microfiber.

#### Look for words 

* polishing compound, scratch, swirl remover, metal polish 1st step
* wax, sealant for the 2nd.

Question: What's the difference between the heavy/medium cut cleaners
and the 105/205 compounds?

Answer: Compounds are the heaviest duty, generally used for heavy
oxidation and scratches on metal, NOT plastic. The polishes are medium
cut products, basically for light oxidation. and then the waxes are
of course the lightest cut, for everyday cleaning and waxing. In each
product line, there are variations from product to product.
