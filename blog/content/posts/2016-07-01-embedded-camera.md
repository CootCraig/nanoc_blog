The Raspberry Pi camera module v2 replaced the original camera module in
April 2016. The v2 camera has a Sony IMX219 8-megapixel sensor (compared
to the 5-megapixel OmniVision OV5647 sensor of the original camera).

Raspberry Pi NoIR Camera Board v2 - 8 Megapixels

Snap, snap! The NoIR Camera v2 is the official "night vision" camera
board released by the Raspberry Pi Foundation!

The Raspberry Pi NoIR Camera Board v2 is a high quality 8 megapixel
Sony IMX219 image sensor custom designed add-on board for Raspberry Pi,
featuring a fixed focus lens. It's capable of 3280 x 2464 pixel static
images, and also support 1080p30, 720p60, and 640x480p60/90 video.

It attaches to the Pi by way of one of the small sockets on the board's
upper surface and uses the dedicated CSi interface, designed especially
for interfacing to cameras.

The NoIR Camera has No InfraRed (NoIR) filter on the lens which makes it
perfect for doing Infrared photography and taking pictures in low light
(twilight) environments.
