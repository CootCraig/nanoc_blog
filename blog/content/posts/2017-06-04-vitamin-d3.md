Target blood level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D of 60-70 ng/ml

Most common dose to achieve this level: 6000 units per day of vitamin D3
(cholecalciferol) in gelcap form to assure absorption. Blood levels of
25-hydroxy vitamin D are advised every 6 months at the start to gauge
the adequacy of dosing

<h3>
  Ten rules to get your vitamin D just right By Dr. Davis | April 20, 2018

Get your 25-hydroxy vitamin D blood level to 60-70 ng/ml, not the 20-30
ng/ml typically quoted by laboratories. This approximates the levels
achieved by young people with plentiful sun exposure, thereby telling us
that this is a physiologically appropriate level. It is also the level
at which risk for diseases like cancer and osteoporosis (via high PTH
levels) are maximally suppressed.

Wait at least 2 months after starting vitamin D or changing the dose
before you check a 25-hydroxy vitamin D blood level, as it takes that
long for the blood level to plateau (read “steady state”). Checking
a level too soon will yield misleading results.

After 2-3 years of consistent supplementation, check a blood level–This
is because many people develop a marked reduction in need at this point. I
don’t know why, but speculate that all vitamin D receptors have become
saturated, thereby yielding higher 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels allowing
a reduction in dose.

Take vitamin D in the morning–Some people develop insomnia if vitamin
D is taken at bedtime, an effect I assume means that the body somehow
equates vitamin D ingestion with sunlight.
