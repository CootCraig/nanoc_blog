If you can drop about 4 dB (40 wpc), I'd recommend the vintage
Harman/Kardon HK-930........ One of the best FM tuners I've heard,
receiver or separate.

If you must have 100 wpc, I'd recommend either a used Onkyo TX-8500
(not Mk II) or Sansui G-901 DB (not G-9000 DB).

### Kenwood KT-880D

[Kenwood KT-880D](http://ham-radio.com/k6sti/kt-880d.htm)

The Kenwood KT-880D is an inexpensive AM/FM tuner with remarkable
performance. It is sensitive. It is one of the few tuners immune to HD
Radio self-noise without modification. Distortion is extremely low, and
unlike many tuners, doesn't rise for weak signals. Finally, resistance
to front-end overload rivals that of tuners with balanced mixers. The
KT-880D uses simple, straightforward circuitry that works so well you
wonder why designers ever bother with fancier circuits.

Grundig S350DL has line outputs. When using them the FM output is in
stereo. Also, the radio allows a double set of batteries to be installed
so if one set dies, just flip the switch and you are good to go though
the D cell battery life is excellent. It is decent enough that it makes
for a good system tuner on a budget. I liked them enough to buy a pair.

### Rotel RT-990BX

[Rotel RT-990BX](http://www.fmtunerinfo.com/reviewsO-R.html)

Rotel RT-990BX (1993, $750) search eBay The FM-only RT-990BX is almost
as good as the very similar RHT10 at a much lower price, according to our
panelist Bob (see Bob's review of the RHT10 above). It is not as rare as
the RHT10 and usually sells for $175-340 on eBay. It has a remote control,
which is required to access the 16 presets, but Bob says the RT-990BX
sounds so good that it is worth buying even without the remote. Other
front-panel controls are stereo/mono switch, RF attenuator, wide/narrow
bandwidth selector and signal-strength indicator. Our contributor David
Rich notes that the RT-990BX has a double-tuned filter at the antenna and
is double-tuned after the RF amp. Here's Bob's comparison of the RHT10
and RT-990BX: "The RHT10 and RT-990BX are essentially the same tuner,
with major cosmetic and minor parts and circuit differences. They
use the same remote control codes, although again, the remotes are
different in appearance. They also use the same circuit board and parts
designations on the board, although the boards are different in color. The
RT-990BX is missing parts in one area, where the stereo blend circuit is
implemented. They have the same RF front end and sine wave type stereo
MPX circuit. Alignment procedure is the same for both. Here is a list
of functional differences I've compiled:

ones? posted by Mercury Boy on April 14, 2009 at 00:21:23:

Luxman T-117 - this is a fabulous tuner for the money (available only
used of course as it was produced in the 80's). I've owned a couple of
MD-102s from Magnum Dynalab and the Luxman comes very close to the sound
quality of these units, which retail for over 2k. I even prefer the
Luxman to the Classe Tuner-1 (but did love having the remote control)
except in the bass department, where the Classe seemed to excel even
over the more expensive MD-102...

Many FM stations are also transmitting HD FM in NYC that interfers with
analog FM. You also need good selectivity. I recommend Kenwood KT-990D
or Sansui TU-D99X that will reject the HD part of the signal due to the
Multiplexer design. Both tuners are quite sensitive & rated high for
good sonics.

Maybe a vintage tuner like a Kenwood KT-7500, when modified can provide
some amazing selectivity. But of course, it's the antenna that really
brings home the bacon...if he doesn't have a Yagi on a rotator, that'd
be something to look in to. A big Yagi like an APS-14 does wonders for
rejecting unwanted signals if the receiver's front end is capable of
dealing with the increased signal strength without overloading :)

I know this will get some hoots but if you want selectivity try a car
radio. They are not the most senstive but excel in selectivity. Other
than that possilby the Grundig Satillit 800. Also, I have a Eton/Grundig
S350DL that seem quite decent and I've not experienced any issues with
adjacent channel selectivity. The 800 has been discontinued but they
are available used for reasonable dollars and the S350DL seems to be
withdrawn quite recently but new ones should be around.
