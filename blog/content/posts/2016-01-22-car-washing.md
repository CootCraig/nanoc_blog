I am also a certifiable towel-aholic; probably have 150+ and I only detail
my own car. I'm always buying new types of towels to see how they perform
for particular tasks. I have found it valuable to designate specific
types of towels for specific uses. Having a variety of different towels
and colors will allow you to maximize the effectiveness of towels by
washing them in the groups you use them for and not cross-contaminating
them or having the colors bleed from dark towels onto light ones. My
advice for starting a well rounded collection based on my experiences
with dozens of types of towels would be this:

Polish removal/wax removal - AG grey 530 and purple 600's. Use one type
for polishes and one type for waxes/sealants. Doesn't really matter
which. If budget is less of a concern, the Microfiber Madness crazy piles
are the absolute best for wax/sealant removal. Depending on how often you
polish or paint clean or wax/seal, a dozen of this category would be good.

Post-wash QD/spray wax/V7 type products - AG gold plush. Great towels
for this and other minor paint related tasks. Good value for the quality
you get. 6-12 of these would be a good starting number.

Wheels - I like using black towels for this. Don't need to be super
high quality. I have about 6 that I got from car-pro, but many sellers
have black.

General interior and all around - A good 350-360 gsm towel for this
purpose. I have a bunch from MF Tech. Good value.

Rinseless - a fluffy 600 gsm towel is good here. I like the 600 greens
from MF Tech. AG has the grey version of these called Chinchilla. Same
as far as I can tell. I tend to use the 800 from Microfiber Madness,
great performers, but again, not budget friendly.

Sacrificial towels - definitely pick up a 36 pack of Costco golds. These
are perfect for messy jobs where you don't really care about what happens
to the towels. Throw them away if you get them really dirty or stained.

Drying - A good korean waffle weave, cobra guzzler, or plush dryer like
the CG Fatty Orange. I like both, but I go Microfiber Madness all the
way. Worth the cost in this category.

A full setup like the above will run you some cash if you buy all at once,
but you can scale up as you need. Towels last a long time if you care for
them well. I have become a recent devotee of Wolfgang towel cleaner. Best
i have used, and I have used several different kinds over the years. Get a
gallon on sale, you will use it up eventually. Wash the different types in
separate loads. As Mike said, if you have a group of each you can avoid
having to wash only a couple towels to keep from cross-contaminating
them. To echo Bkdazzle's post, towels are a good investment, and your
best value is not found in the cheapest towels (other than Costco).

Note the photo, Grit Guards offset by 45°.

If there is one thing that is a flaw, is that sometimes they'll tend
to 'float'. Even stacked two-up they'll float! I've alleviated that by
drilling holes in the fins and putting a few pointed slip leader fishing
weights in the holes, glued in with hot glue.

Then as they are connected at 45° to one another, again, a small hole
in the bottom of the fins of the top one, then just hook them together
with small 4" wire ties.

Works like a CHARM.

I have dual guards in my wash bucket as well as rinse bucket. Then have a
single one in the wheel bucket. Having dual guards keeps the wash water
so clean that you can use it twice! After that, pour it off next time
in the wheel bucket. Nothing goes to waste.

As for sponges (especially man made) uhhhhh..... I'll stick to microfiber
mitts and Merino wool like the CarPro one. Natural sponges have been known
to do well, but really no need when you have good microfiber or wool ones.

Truthfully.... I *MUCH* prefer 16" silk edge towels over edgeless and/or
rolled edge.  Easier to control (when wiping compound and polish) than
edgeless and CHEAPER than the same exact material with a rolled edge!


#### <a href="http://www.autogeekonline.net/forum/ask-mike-phillips-your-detailing-questions/97051-making-first-big-purchase-2.html#post1321671" target="_blank">cardaddy - Re: Making the first big purchase</a>

Lemee ask ya' this... do you have grit guards in both your buckets? I
actually have TWO in each bucket, turned 45°, and connected with wire
ties. Completely stops sloshing around, and keeps the soap solution so
clean that you can use it twice. After two uses, just dump it in the
wheel bucket (which has a single grit guard).


Microfiber Tech and The Rag Company has by far the best, safest, and
most affordable offerings. (There are of course the "German" companies
but... be prepared to sell an organ.) If I had to have only 3 towels
it'd be the Microfiber Tech 360's, 530's and Korean 500's as they'll do
anything you need, including drying (with the 530's). Can't say that I
actually DO make that work however.

Bottom line is you'll need a couple dozen of each of your most used
towels. If that is the 360 and 530 then yup... get a couple dozen of
each. You can get around with less of the Korean's if you want, say if
you're only using them for QD duties, but even then you'd do good to
have 5~6.

I followed other users' advice of using a large bucket with a "Grit Guard"
installed to catch dirty residues at the bottom and also having multiple
dry cloths available for the washing and drying process. It is important
that the product be applied to one region of the car at a time and dried
before moving to the next region. This is essentially a "two-cloth"
method. For my Prius, I actually use one wash mitt for application and
then have about six to eight small microfibre cloths available for drying.

##### Description

The Korean Plush Zero Edge Microfiber Detailing Towels have a high pile
on both sides. Soft and plush with long fibers to pull particles away
from the surface being wiped, they to help prevent scratching and swirl
marks. The ultrasonic Zero Edge design means you don’t have to worry
about stitched or banded edges that can cause damage to soft paint. They
are great for wax and polish residue removal, quick detail sprays,
rinseless car wash, and delicate finish work.

##### Reviews

This towel is great at removing sealant, glaze, wax and etc. Plus,
it's super soft. Best microfiber towel I have used.

Every now and again you come across a towel that's worth a large
order. This is the towel. Korean made, high quality, stays super soft
after proper washing/drying, no edge, best towel in my arsenal.

Soooo soft and fluffy i use these for my qds and final wipedowns . They
seem very well made, wash great, with no shedding. Never can have enough
of these towels around.

These towels are super soft, not grabby like traditional microfiber
towels..A++

##### Description

The Edgeless Polishing Towel features a closed loop construction which
is designed for wiping away polish and wax residue. It's soft touch, and
non-stitched edge makes it safe for use on the most delicate clearcoat
surfaces. Scratches are virtually impossible.

Even the thickest paste waxes will be easily removed without caking. If
you want to make the removal of tough waxes and polishes an easy task,
the Edgeless Polishing Towel is the tool for you.

This towel excels in other applications also, most notably glass
cleaning. The closed loop construction leaves behind no lint or streaking,
leaving you with ultra clear glass and mirrors.

##### Reviews

I used these towels as wax removal towels on our vehicles recently. They
worked beautifully. I tried with both a sealant and a WOWO wax. Both
were effortless. I''d buy them again.

Excellent quality, a step above the usual. Used for wax and sealant
removal.Would buy again

I have used these for quick detailing, bird dropping removal, and window
cleaning. These towels performed all tasks I have tried very well,
and at this price point they are a great value.

Excellent drying towel. Fast shipping. This towel holds a lot of water
and can get heavy. One towel is enough for the average vehicle although I
always have at least 2 available in case of soiling or dropping. No lint,
no sewn tag and very soft edge. This is a winner!

I have tried waffle weave towels from a detail website that I buy my
chemicals and waxes from with less than impressive results. That was my
first experience so I decided to give Microfiber Tech's Korean waffle a
try. The quality of these waffles trump ALL the others like dynamite in
a rock-paper-scissor game! These waffles are super-soft and incredibly
thirsty! I only wish I would have found Microfiber Tech sooner! All the
products I buy from this company rocks. I've never bought a bad product
through this website. Shipping is always fast too! I was NOT reimbursed
for this review.

As a new detailing business, I wasn't quite sure if I wanted to spend $13
on a single towel. But it is worth every penny invested into it. This
thing just seems to DRINK water. It's absorbency coupled with its size
allowed me to dry two SUV's (CR-V and Lexus GX350h) in one go. Great
towel.

Our business is a collision repair facility. Our detail dept. LOVES this
towel. Said that it is the best towel to dry off even our black high
end cars. No streaking, no lint, absorbs. We will be ordering more in
the future.

The MicroChamois is the modern version of the traditional leather chamois,
except it is softer, more gentle and more absorbent than its 20th century
predecessor. It is machine washable, will last hundreds of uses, will
not harden when dry, and will stay soft for a long time.

It is made of non-woven 100% polyamide microfibers (polyamide is the
more absorbent component of microfiber), which have an extremely quick
absorption rate and high water retention. Its low pile means it is
virtually streak free.

Once it is saturated wring it out and use it over and over again.
