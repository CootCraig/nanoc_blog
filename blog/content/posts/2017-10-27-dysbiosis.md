  Dysbiosis and SIBO

<h4>Dr. Davis Posted: 7/22/2017 12:54:13 PM</h4>

As you are all discovering, there is no one way to deal with SIBO,
certainly no foolproof, ideal way.

I favor using one of the herbal antibiotic preparations for 2 weeks while
including a prebiotic fiber. Ideally, an H2 breath test is performed
before and after to gauge effect.

What I don’t know is whether a course of FODMAPS after the antibiotic
course is beneficial, since no antibiotic is 100% effective. In many
trials, antibiotics are no more than 50% effective.

Mrs. Chung--If the prebiotic shakes cause distress, it is virtually
certain that you have severe dysbiosis, likely SIBO. Some people in
this situation succeed just by taking only the high-potency probiotic
and fermented foods while holding off on the prebiotics for 4 weeks,
then trying again. But if distress recurs, then it’s time to explore
SIBO issues.

I have been on the antibiotics Dysbiocide and FC-Cide for one week.
I felt a little sick the first few days.   I am taking the prebiotic
shake daily as recommended by Dr. Davis but no probiotics.   Yesterday,
for the first time since starting Undoctored,  I had no stomach upset,
gas or bloating from the shake.  Today I increased to 2 Tsp of inulin and
1/2 a medium raw potato and tolerated that well.  I plan to do another
week of the antibiotics, then start repopulating with probiotics and
continuing the shakes.  I am feeling great now, lots of energy and
ketosis has been easy to maintain.  Fibromyalgia symptoms have been
under control with lower pain and no IBS for an entire week.

<h4>Dr. Davis Posted: 9/28/2017 3:20:15 PM</h4>
 
The Prebiotic Shakes are probably too much for you right now, Zucker.

We find that adding a low dose of prebiotic, perhaps 2-3 days into your
antibiotic regiment, is better tolerated, i.e., allows the antibiotic
to start the die-off process before you introduce any quantity of
prebiotic. Based on the one study looking at this, we have been adding
a dose of 5-10 grams to start, e.g., one teaspoon inulin, small serving
of legumes/chickpeas/hummus. Build up to 20 grams total per day over time.

<h4>Ceithlenn Posted: 9/29/2017 7:10:14 AM</h4>
 
My experience validates what Dr. Davis said above. When I started the
dysbiocide and FC cidal I waited a couple of days and then started adding
small amounts of Prebiotic fiber. I was using the raw potato and inulin
FOS. I would only tolerate about 10 grams of raw potato, which is just
a small slice and about a quarter teaspoon of inulin fos. I gradually
increased  the prebiotics a tiny bit each day over the month  that I
used the antibiotics After about a week I was up to about 20 G a raw
potato and about a teaspoon of inulin. By the end of the month I was
doing 100 G of potato, almost an entire medium potato, and two teaspoons
of inulin. For me it was the gauge of how much the SIBO had improved.
Those were my results and I hope you have some that are similar

<h4>Bob Niland Posted: 10/23/2017 8:13:22 PM</h4>

Dr. Davis : Personally, I’ve wondered whether adding a brief course
of some form of emulsifier (that we usually avoid or minimize) would be
the solution, as they can emulsify/disrupt some forms of biofilms.

Acacia fiber might be an interesting go-to, if this line of thought
develops, being both a prebiotic and an emulsifier.

<h4>Herbal antibiotics --e.g. Candibactin-AR®/-BR®</h4>

I believe there’s some evidence to suggest that the best solution are
herbal antibiotics or antimicrobials, and those are discussed below [below
the video], such as Candibactin AR and BR. Anecdotal evidence suggests
they work. One study compared the herbal antimicrobials/antibiotics to
rifaximin, and the herbal preparations were somewhat superior, and did
not come with risk for clostridium difficile. So I think that should be
your first choice if you want to go the antibiotic route.

It’s not clear how long you do these things, but I think two weeks is
probably a pretty good time line. Longer periods have been tried with
the antibiotic rifaximin, and it doesn’t seem to yield any further
benefit. Shorter courses yield less effect, like seven days, so I think
a good compromise is 14 days, maybe as short as 10 days.

<h3>Herbal antimicrobials:</h3>

One study has demonstrated that the mix of herbal antimicrobials in either
FC Cidal + Dysbiocide (Biotics Research Laboratories) or Candibactin-AR +
Candibactin-BR (Metagenics) slightly outperformed prescription rifaximin
with 46% effectiveness in the herbal arm vs. 34% in the rifaximin
arm. Each preparation contains a mixture of herbal preparations and it
is unclear whether every component is necessary for efficacy. (Berberine,
a component of Candibactin-BR, for example, may prove to be effective by
itself. There are insufficient data at present, however.) In this study,
also, the regimen used was slightly different than that recommended by
the manufacturer. (Candibactin-AR labeling recommends one capsule three
times per day, while the study used two capsules twice per day.)
