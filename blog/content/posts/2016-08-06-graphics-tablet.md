subject: Huion support.  1060 plus, 680s

My office system and laptop are both running Debian.  I am researching purchasing a Huion support 1060 plus for the office and a Huion 680s for the laptop.

I found one mailing list thread on the Huion 1060 plus:

https://sourceforge.net/p/digimend/mailman/digimend-users/thread/CAKwYL5HKA_Xb6mWUZUx3Q5gP%3DMG_7rFuapDVQu1coho7-q%3DaNA%40mail.gmail.com/#msg33510111

I'm currently using these application: inkscape, gimp, freecad, openscad.

Before I do the buys, I'd like to hear about support for these 2 tablets.
If there are issues, what alternatives would be currently recommended?

Later,
Craig Anderson

Krita isnâ€™t much fun without a pressure sensitive tablet. If the tablet
has been properly configured, Krita works with Wacom, Huion and other
uc-logic based tablets, on Windows and Linux (look below for more infos
on Huion Linux support).

Nicolas11x12TECHX - HUION 1060 Plus Graphics Drawing Tablet Review

### An Amazon review


TL;DR So anyone considering the 1060 Pro+ should really just get the 1060 Plus


Is there any difference in the surface of the 1060 compared to the h610 pro?

Answer:

The 1060 pro+ and the h610 pro have identical technical specs except
for the Micro SD card slot. I have been comparing these two tablets for
some time, and I thought I would add a few more differences for people
comparing the two. One other important thing to note for people looking
to buy one of these. The 1060 Pro+ and the 1060 Pro are the same tablet,
they're just listed differently here on amazon. THERE IS A DIFFERENT
1060, the 1060 Plus, which is an UPGRADE to the 1060 Pro+ (or Pro, same
tablet). The 1060 Plus includes support for all 12 hot keys. Now that
that's been explained, I will move on to the full comparison.

1)Althought the 1060 pro+ technically has 12 physical buttons, the
software only supports 8, and it is not likely that support will be added
in the future, as most of their tablets only have 8 buttons. The upgraded
model, the 1060 Plus, has full support for the 12 physical buttons.

2)The physical dimensions of the tablet itself differs slightly between
models. All 3, the H610 Pro, the 1060 Pro+ and the 1060 Plus have the
same physical dimensions of 360mmx240mmx10mm. The 1060s, however, have a
listed reading distance of .4", where the H610 Pro is listed as .6", so
i suspect that either the drawing surface is either slightly recessed on
the 1060s, or that they are sligtly slimmer, and the reason for the depth
dimension being the same as the H610 Pro is that the buttons stick out
a bit instead of being slightly recessed. The H610 is slightly lighter,
at 635g. Both 1060s are 770g.

3)It appears that the Huion logo in between the physical buttons on the
left hand side may light up a blue color during use. I'm not positive,
but it looks like it from the pictures that are displayed here. Purely
cosmetic, only worth mentioning because of how few differences there
are between the two.

Aside from the Micro SD card functionality and the physical button layout,
the H610 and 1060 Pro+ are almost identical. I personally prefer the
recessed buttons, and the button layout of the H610 Pro as I am left
handed and was concerned about pressing the buttons by accident, but
all of the Huions I have mentioned have support for inverting the tablet
for left handed use. The on screen hot buttons will be upside down when
inverted, but having 16 upside-down hot buttons is much better than
no hot buttons at all (Like other budget comptetitors, or even Wacom)
Between the H610 Pro and the 1060 Pro+, I probably would have chosen the
H610 Pro just because I prefer the button layout a little better, and was
willing to sacrifice the SD card slot for it. But the 1060 Plus changes
all of that with the addition of 4 more buttons. I will be getting a 1060
Plus in order to gain the added Micro SD card slot feature (up to 64GB)
and 4 extra physical buttons. If you want support for the extra physical
buttons, MAKE SURE TO GET THE 1060 PLUS, NOT THE 1060 Pro or Pro+.

Edit: I read a Huion post on Tumblr where they also state that the 1060
plus includes an 8gb Micro SD card, along with an upgraded drawing
surface texture that is smoother and doesn't make as much noise as
previous ones. On DeviantArt I read a post from a happy 1060 Plus owner
that confirms it actually does have a smoother, more quiet texture. So
anyone considering the 1060 Pro+ should really just get the 1060 Plus
instead, you get an 8gb card instead of a 4gb one, support for the
4 extra buttons, and a finer drawing surface texture for ten dollars
more. Hopefully Amazon will stock them soon so that we don't have to
wait two weeks or more for shipping from China.
