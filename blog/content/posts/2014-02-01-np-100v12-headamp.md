## DIY 12AU7 (ECC82) Tube / IRF510 MOSFET Headphone Amplifier

The NP-100v12 is a simple headphone amplifier that allows an entry
level builder to experience assembling and listening to their own
creation. I use the term builder as electronic experience combined with
innovation which allows the creation of a device, rather than simple
board stuffing. This amplifier can take on many shapes and sizes;
I especially like when builders reuse older devices as cases and even
recycle some components from various discarded power supplies. I try to
keep price at a minimum because this amplifier is very basic and allows
the builder to seek out theory, and actually "listen" to their music,
and grow to build more complex projects in the future.
