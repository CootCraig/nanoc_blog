<h2>A community Bash framework.</h2>

<h3>

  Bash-it repo
</h3>

Bash-it is a collection of community Bash commands and scripts for Bash
3.2+. (And a shameless ripoff of oh-my-zsh :smiley:)

Includes autocompletion, themes, aliases, custom functions, a few stolen
pieces from Steve Losh, and more.

Bash-it provides a solid framework for using, developing and maintaining
shell scripts and custom commands for your daily work. If you're using the
Bourne Again Shell (Bash) on a regular basis and have been looking for an
easy way on how to keep all of these nice little scripts and aliases under
control, then Bash-it is for you! Stop polluting your ~/bin directory
and your .bashrc file, fork/clone Bash-it and start hacking away.

<h4>Install</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Check out a clone of this repo to a location of your choice, such as: git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it.git ~/.bash_it</li>
  <li>Run ~/.bash_it/install.sh (it automatically backs up your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc, depending on your OS)</li>
  <li>Edit your modified config (~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc) file in order to customize Bash-it.</li>
  <li>Check out available aliases, completions and plugins and enable the ones you want to use (see the next section for more details).</li>
</ol>
