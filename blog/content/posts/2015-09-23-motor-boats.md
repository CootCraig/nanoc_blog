Beaver Tail Ambush

BT Ambush is the latest model to join our fleet. This awesome set-up knows
no limits, it can be propelled using a push pole, paddle, trolling motor,
or small outboard which truly makes this the most versatile ‘one man’
fishing platform available period.

Featuring a self bailing cockpit, custom non skid through out, complete
with a dry plentiful storage compartment as standard, it is not not hard
to be impressed with a true draft of 2 3/4″ loaded. Imagine you can
now ditch the waders and go venture in the shallowest waters you never
dreamed possible!

Comfort remains a  key buying factor for all our BT Skiff owners and
with the BT Ambush it is no different, with the surprisingly stable
and smooth ride whether standing up or sitting down even in a light
chop. When at rest it remains easy to walk from the front to the aft
section and getting on or off is effortless.

Have BT Ambush will travel! weighing in at a meager 125 lbs transporting
could not be easier, either on the roof of your car, bed of your truck,
or a small trailer is available if needed.

If you’re ready to get up and go start your BT Ambush adventure today,
we have a dealer network in place. Contact us to find your nearest dealer
ready to assist. Beavertail Skiffs where life is good!

The Swift Canoe 16

The fine hull will travel fast with little HP. In displacement mode,
the Swift will go much faster than a wider boat. She moves with less
fuss and creates only a small wake.

Price: $50.00 



http://www.bateau.com/studyplans/D15_study.htm

The Indian River Skiff is a planing hull with a flat bottom similar to our power dories but lighter, more economical and faster to build. Capacity is 3 to 5 persons depending on circumstances. She will plane with a 10 HP, max. power is 25 HP with remote steering. Some builders have installed a small center console. At 5' wide, she can be rowed in case of emergency or for a silent approach to a fishing spot.

This boats transom is designed for a standard 15" shaft. The transom can easily be modified to accept other shaft lengths.

NEW (Jan.2001): We added a third layout plan to the package. We now show a fully decked layout ideal for fishing.

Build the New Instant Boats 
Harold Payson

Published by International Marine/Ragged Mountain Press (1984-12-15)

Get to Know Our Company

Harold H. Payson, known to associates, friends, and his wife as Dynamite,
thinks you can build a boat. Years ago, when Dynamite began supplementing
his boatbuilding work by selling boat plans, he got feedback from a
number of customers who found the boats too difficult to build.

Many of these would-be boat builders had never heard of lofting, and were
intimidated and discouraged by the necessity of building a jig before
building the boat itself. In addition, many of them could not find local
suppliers of the lumber and other materials called for by the plans.

Selling plans for boats that never got built went against Dynamite's down
east grain, and it was also, he figured, "a straight road to bankruptcy
in the long run." He outlined the problem to Philip Bolger, of Gloucester,
Massachusetts, arguably the most innovative small craft designer around.

Bolger agreed, on one condition, to design a series of boats that would
require no lofting, no jig, and no lumber that could not be obtained
at any local building supplies store. They would also design boats that
would not require a great investment of time to cut out and button up.

In short, they would design boats for the inexperienced builder whose
fundamental desire is to get out on the water. The one condition was that
Dynamite would build and thoroughly test a prototype of each design to
wring out every bug before offering the plans for sale.

Dynamite readily agreed, and a felicitous partnership was born. The
eventual result was the original fleet of six boats described in his
first book, Instant Boats.

Scarfing Basics is the latest 'how-to' book by Russell Brown, since
publishing Epoxy Basics in 2013. These books do not come into being
casually. Every photo requires a good subject and what presented itself
in the shop this summer was scarfing. There are often 'how to scarf'
questions online and a wide range of opinions shared that can sometimes
cause more confusion than real help.  The builder is still left to pick
and choose how to proceed. For Russell, "strong, clean, and accurate"
are the words of the day. This book describes the methods of the author
in direct concise language and large color photographs. While there are
multiple ways to scarf plywood and lumber, this book is a great place
to start and/or perfect your scarfing skills. Amateur and professional
woodworkers alike will find good information and tips in this book for
Cutting and Gluing, Strong, Straight, and Clean Scarf Joints in Plywood
and Lumber, including making your own jigs for table saw and router.


Epoxy Basics was originally the epoxy addendum to our construction
manuals for small boat kits produced by Port Townsend Watercraft. By
request, we have created both an e-book and a full color print book
based on the ‘addendum’ but enhanced with additional information
and pictures. This is not intended to be a complete “how-to,” but it
does give a concise  overview of working with epoxy, describing methods
used by the author for, Gluing, Filleting, Glassing, and Coating. There
are 46 pages of full color photos and detailed instruction.
