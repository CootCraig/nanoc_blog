#### Comment on newer OPD 20 lb tanks

In response to Lanc Mac's question about anti tip-over valve causing it
to stop flowing.  I think you're talking about OPD (Overfill Protection
Device) equipped tanks. As of April 1, 2002 all four- to 40-pound propane
tanks must be equipped with an Overfill Protection Device. This is a
new valve that replaces the one on existing tanks. The new valves are
marked with "OPD" to designate their compliance with the state law and
have three-lobed valve handles, rather than the five-lobe type found
on older propane tanks. The OPD valve is simply a protective device
that, as the name implies, prevents overfilling of a propane cylinder.
The OPD valve does NOT prevent you from flowing liquid when the tank is
on it's side or inverted.  The tank in this video is a newer tank and is
OPD equipped.   I find no information on a true tip-over valve installed
in the common BBQ tanks.  There are valves in the hook up fittings to
BBQ equipment and camper/motorhomes that prevent fast flow in case lines
are cut to prevent the free-flow of gas/liquid in an accident, but those
fixtures also usually have regulators/mixers to deal with liquid propane.

##### <a href="http://www.survivalistboards.com/showthread.php?t=271593" target="_blank">Survivalistsboards - Product Review: Mr. Heater Big Buddy MH18B Propane Heater.</a>

Total run time on the low setting was 8.25 hours. That comes out to
about 0.25 lbs. of propane per hour on the low setting. By the way,
you do not need to have both propane bottles installed to run the heater.

...

Running from a 20 lb. or larger tank is easy once you sort through
the numerous options. The Buddy has a "quick release" propane input
that bypasses the internal regulators. To use it, you must use a hose
with a regulator on it, or have a regulator on your tank. Connecting an
unregulated propane hose to the quick-release will force high pressure
gas into the heater and create a very dangerous condition. The optional
F271803 hose will safely hook your Buddy to a large tank. Wallet
Alert...the hose costs about $40.

...

I realize all these hose/filter/regulator/connector combinations are
a bit overwhelming! I'm going with the regulated hose with the quick
connect to avoid the hassle of filters or recalcitrant non-gooey hoses.

...

Although the Buddy is marketed as a "ventless" heater, the manufacturer
nonetheless recommends an 18 square inch fresh air source. That's not a
lot; most homes are kind of "leaky" anyway. I did notice that the air
in the room had an odd funk about it while the heater was running. It
did not make me sick and it wasn't unacceptable, but it was evident. The
funk went away when I cracked the door a little.

The Buddy has a built-in fan that runs on four internal D batteries or
an external 6 volt DC source. It greatly improves the efficiency of the
heater even if the batteries cannot be expected to last as long as the
propane. The jack for the optional AC adapter ($17) is this tiny little
thing that looks just strange. Nearly every other similar device in the
known universe has a common DC barrel plug. I don't understand why a
product that is so well thought out in every other way would use such
a cheezy off-the-map power jack.

#### Internal Fan

4 D Cells or Heater can also be powered by electrical adapter
F276127. Required adapter to be 6 volt DC up to 800 mil liamp current
with positive tip polarity
