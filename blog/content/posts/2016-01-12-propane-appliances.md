#### Comment on newer OPD 20 lb tanks

In response to Lanc Mac's question about anti tip-over valve causing it
to stop flowing.  I think you're talking about OPD (Overfill Protection
Device) equipped tanks. As of April 1, 2002 all four- to 40-pound propane
tanks must be equipped with an Overfill Protection Device. This is a
new valve that replaces the one on existing tanks. The new valves are
marked with "OPD" to designate their compliance with the state law and
have three-lobed valve handles, rather than the five-lobe type found
on older propane tanks. The OPD valve is simply a protective device
that, as the name implies, prevents overfilling of a propane cylinder.
The OPD valve does NOT prevent you from flowing liquid when the tank is
on it's side or inverted.  The tank in this video is a newer tank and is
OPD equipped.   I find no information on a true tip-over valve installed
in the common BBQ tanks.  There are valves in the hook up fittings to
BBQ equipment and camper/motorhomes that prevent fast flow in case lines
are cut to prevent the free-flow of gas/liquid in an accident, but those
fixtures also usually have regulators/mixers to deal with liquid propane.
