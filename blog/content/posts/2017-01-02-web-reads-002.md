  Jim Rickards’ Strategic Intelligence
</h4>

The goal of Jim Rickards’ Strategic Intelligence is simple — help you
prepare and profit from the coming collapse of the dollar. Your editor
will be Jim Rickards. According to him, “the end of the international
monetary system is imminent and it will wipe out millions of unprepared
Americans.”

He’s uniquely qualified to help you too — spending over 35 years in
investment banking, international economics and politics and national
intelligence advisory roles. His contacts and experience will allow you
to hear the most crucial strategic market intelligence first, so you
can profit before anyone else.

To safely guide your investments, Jim has developed a revolutionary
way of looking at the financial system and stock markets. It’s unlike
anything you’ve ever seen.

It gives him insight on exactly how the dollar’s collapse could play
out, what stocks might fall, and what assets could rocket up in price. His
predictive tool – something he calls “complexity theory” – will
warn you well in advance of the coming collapse. In the financial world,
this tool is entirely new and unparalleled.

PART 2) AFFORDABILITY LOST ON THE RATE SURGE (from my recent note on
post rate-surge affordability).

Bottom line: The rate surge took away 11% of purchasing power, which
will drag on house prices. It comes as houses cost the most ever to the
end-user, shelter-buyer (see FOUR charts below).

<h5>Our Mission</h5>

We are a service orientated teaching forum that uses the daily market
as its text and blackboard. We comment, but every commentary carries a
lesson. The Spin really does stop here.

<h5>Jim Sinclair</h5>

Jim Sinclair is primarily a precious metals specialist and a commodities
and foreign currency trader. He founded the Sinclair Group of Companies
(1977), which offered full brokerage services in stocks, bonds, and other
investment vehicles. The companies, which operated branches in New York ,
Kansas City, Toronto , Chicago , London and Geneva , were sold in 1983.

From 1981 to 1984, Mr. Sinclair served as a Precious Metals Advisor to
Hunt Oil and the Hunt family for the liquidation of their silver position
as a prerequisite for the $1 billion loan arranged by the Chairman of
the Federal Reserve, Paul Volcker.

He was also a General Partner and Member of the Executive Committee
of two New York Stock Exchange firms and President of Sinclair Global
Clearing Corporation (commodity clearing firm) and Global Arbitrage
(derivative dealer in metals and currencies).

In April 2002, shareholders of Tanzanian Royalty Exploration (formerly
Tan Range Exploration) approved the acquisition of Tanzania American
International, a company managed by the Sinclair family.  Following this
transaction, Mr. Sinclair became Chairman of Tanzanian Royalty and now
leads its efforts to become a gold producer and royalty company.

Most recently in 2013, Jim accepted the position of Executive Chairman
for the newly formed Singapore Precious Metals Exchange.
