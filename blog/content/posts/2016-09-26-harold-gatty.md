Harold Gatty

Harold Charles Gatty (5 January 1903 – 30 August 1957) was an Australian

of Navigators".[1] In 1931, Gatty served as navigator, along with pilot
Wiley Post, on the flight which set the record for aerial circumnavigation
of the world, flying a distance of 15,747 miles (24,903 km) in a Lockheed
Vega named the Winnie Mae, in 8 days, 15 hours and 51 minutes.
