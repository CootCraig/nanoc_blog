Electric Fillet Knife

Academy Tournament Choice KnifeI finally settled on the Academy Tournament
Choice Electric Fillet Knife.

There’s nothing special about it, it’s not as powerful as my beloved
MT3, it won’t last for extended periods of time under heavy use (for a
weekend angler you’ll get a lot of life out of it) and there’s really
no “wow factor” at but in a slough of mediocre electric fillet knives
it’s the best!

That’s not a knock on Academy. I love their store and they make good
products. Judging from all of the products on the market, it’s hard
to build an amazing product when it comes to electric fillet knives.

Here’s why I’m using the Academy Tournament Choice Electric Fillet
Knife:

* It’s cheap at a whopping $19.99 full price.
* It works as well as all others on the market and significantly better than all of the other $20 to $30 options and it performs as well as the $50-$60 electric fillet knives on the market.
* Academy stands behind any product with the Tournament Choice name on it (their store brand). I don’t abuse the fact that they do this but on occassion I’ll have a knife that only lasts a couple of days. I take it back and they make it right!
* It accepts the Mister Twister Fillet Knife Blades. That’s important. Keep reading and I’ll explain why.

Mister Twister 9” Electric Fillet Knife Blades

Mister Twister Electric Knife BladesThe #1 requirement on my list for
an electric fillet knife is that it must work with the Mister Twister
9” Electric Fillet Knife Blades.

Fillet knife blades have to be replaced often, and these are the best,
and they’re the only replacement blades that are readily available.

The Mister Twister Electric Fillet Knife Blades are super sharp right
out of the package but the main reason they work so well is they’re
much more flexible than most electric fllet knife blades. The ability
to slightly flex the blades while cleaning catfish is essential to the
process I use.

Always make sure you have good sharp knife blades. Dull blades will make
this process much more difficult and will reduce the life of your knife
(and are dangerous as well).  Fillet Knife (Not Electric)

Dexter Russell Fillet Knife

You need a good quality fillet knife. Not
an electric model like previously mentioned, just a good old fashioned
piece of sharpened steel that you’ll power with some elbow grease.

There’s a ton of fillet knives on the market of various quality.

In recent years the Bubbe Blade has been all the rage. I listened to
the Bubba Blade hype for a couple of years and then one of my clients
gave me one. I’m really glad I didn’t spend money on it, it’s
dissapointing at best and certainly not a $50 fillet knife. I really
like the handle but beyond that it’s a major letdown and I’d take
a basic Dexter Russell Fillet Knife over it any day.

If you want an even better quality knife the Cutco Fisherman’s Solution
has a huge following and I’ve never heard anyone say a bad word about
them. They have an almost cult-like following. I’ve simply never used
one because it’s sort of a hassle to get them. Everytime I’ve seen
them in person it’s been at a fair or event and I didn’t want to be
the guy that walks around with a big knife all day.
