Pueblo has three species of black bass
(largemouth, smallmouth, and spotted).
Numbers of bass in Pueblo Reservoir are
high. 

Walley, wiper

Pueblo has three species of catfish (channel, flat-
head, and blue)

Pueblo Reservoir also contains fishable populations of black and
white crappie, bluegill, yellow perch and rainbow trout. 


Pueblo has three species of catfish (channel, flat-
head, and blue). Numbers of catfish in Pueblo
Reservoir have been fairly consistent in recent
years and appeared to be made up of fairly large
fish. A good number of catfish over 18” can be
caught. Blue catfish, primarily discontinued
from the stocking schedule due to poor sur-
vival, were stocked in 2013 as extra fish were
available. Blue catfish are rare, but the possi-
bility of catching one and making a new state
record is possible. Channel catfish have been
more abundant than flathead catfish, but the
number of flatheads has increased in recent
years, which will make for another state re-
cord possibility. The state record Flathead
Catfish and Blue Catfish have both come from
Pueblo Reservoir.
In 2014, catch rates for catfish will likely be
decent, especially if you target them. The
quality of fish could be very high. 


The 18” and over size group
was larger than recent years but still relatively small. Gill-
net samples do not do a good job of assessing the status of
larger walleye in the reservoir. These larger fish are present
in the reservoir in good numbers but
are difficult to catch, especially when
gizzard shad are numerous. Average
catches of walleye in Pueblo Reser-
voir yields around 3 to 7 legal fish per
100 fish caught. 2013 was a banner
year for legal walleye, and 2014
should be very similar

The highest catch rates for walleye
will usually occur from mid
May to
the end of June. At this time the fish
will be located on the flats and points
in shallow water and will be feeding
heavily. Anglers looking for larger
fish should use larger baits and move
away from the large schools of small
fish. Catch rates will be significantly
lower, but quality of fish will be sig-
nificantly higher

Since 1960, a history of developing and marketing innovative fish &
game technology.

Vektor™ Fish & Game Forecasts' roots go back to 1960 when John Uldrich
and Robert Knutson, both avid hunters and fishermen from Little Falls,
Minnesota, founded Vexilar Engineering Inc. Their first product in
the fishing arena was the Deptherm™ - a unique and simple tool for
finding depth and temperature. Still in production by Vexilar Inc.,
over a million of these units have been sold. In 1965 they acquired an
electronic temperature sensing device from Honeywell Inc. which also
served as a depth finder. No longer in production, it did put Vexilar
into the electronics sector relating to fishing and opened the door to
sonar equipment which they first imported from Japan.

Pioneering high-resolution, solid state fish location display technology.

By 1968 Uldrich and Knutson were designing and producing leading
edge sonar equipment, pioneering the use of ‘sound’ in sonar,
liquid crystal displays and light emitting diodes for display purposes
(LEDs). They were the first to offer high resolution solid state displays
(Video Sonar™) which are now the standard of the industry.

They continued to research the impact of temperature on fish feeding and
migration patterns and collaborated with the magazine called “Fishing
World” for many years on this subject. Click here to see the current
temperature chart.

As president of Vexilar Inc., Uldrich was inducted into the original
Fishing Hall of Fame for his work on fish temperature correlations and his
effort to use advanced technology in the development of fishing finding
equipment. Vexilar, under Uldrich’s presidency, pioneered the use of
existing sonar for recovery work by Law Enforcement officers and agencies.

Fish & Game Forecast Begins.

In 1973, Vexilar took on the project of marketing a Fish & Game Forecast
service offered by DataSport, then of Minneapolis. When the two partners
sold the company (Vexilar) in 1980, John Uldrich formed Vektor™ to
continue the fish and game services under that name. The use of NOAA
data took place at this time and continues to this day.

Vexilar is a Latin term meaning “a soldier on the leading edge” and
“Vektor” was used in the forecast service because the NOAA formula
relies exclusively on the use of the 37-constituent forces which drive
our planetary system thus creating the tide predicting data. This is
based on the mathematics of “Vector Analysis” – hence “Vektor”.

Vexilar 104 Deptherm

We at Vexilar have a long and proud history of innovation in fishing
products. Lets take a look at who we are and where we came from. Vexilar
has been in the marine business since 1960. We have always been a small
company with good hard working employees. Our goal has simply been to
offer the sportsman innovative and quality products at affordable prices.

Our first product was a small clear tube that, when lowered
under the surface of the water, gave the depth that it was
lowered to. It also gave the temperature of the water at that
depth. The product was the model 104 Deptherm and it is still
in our product line today, over 50+ years later. - See more at:
http://www.vexilar.com/pages/the-history#sthash.EAWWX5ON.dpuf

The fishing odds are on your side every time you go out with a Deptherm,
model 104, for two simple but important reasons. It tells you quickly and
accurately what temperatures are below your boat and it also tells you
how deep these temperature ranges go. Thus, if you have the temperature
chart, you quickly know whether you're fishing in a spot where the fish
are most apt to be. If your Deptherm shows the water too cold or too
warm for the species you're after, you can quickly move just as the fish
do. You won't be wasting the day in the wrong place.

Deptherm works like this: dropped on a line, growing pressure forces water
into the tube as the instrument descends. The volume of water trapped in
the tube serves as a depth measurement column and is read off the side
of the tube calibrated in feet. The thermometer on the other side assures
close temperature readings if the instrument is left down for 30 seconds.

General Application - Attach the Deptherm to line and let sink to bottom
or any intermediate depth. Hold there for 30 seconds and return to
surface. Read depth on the calibrated side at the top of the water column
and temperature off the temperature plate. Invert instruments; press
valve to release water. Shake until all water is out before using again.

Downrigger Application - Clip the Deptherm Model 104 to your
downrigger ball for monitoring water temperature and depth at the
downrigger. When raising the ball for re-rigging, check the temperature
and depth. Temperature readings on the Deptherm will not change while
ball is being raised due to a delayed reaction (1 to 2 minutes).

Electric Fillet Knife

Academy Tournament Choice KnifeI finally settled on the Academy Tournament
Choice Electric Fillet Knife.

There’s nothing special about it, it’s not as powerful as my beloved
MT3, it won’t last for extended periods of time under heavy use (for a
weekend angler you’ll get a lot of life out of it) and there’s really
no “wow factor” at but in a slough of mediocre electric fillet knives
it’s the best!

That’s not a knock on Academy. I love their store and they make good
products. Judging from all of the products on the market, it’s hard
to build an amazing product when it comes to electric fillet knives.

http://www.academy.com/shop/pdp/tournament-choice-electric-fillet-knife/pid-1000662

Here’s why I’m using the Academy Tournament Choice Electric Fillet
Knife:

* It’s cheap at a whopping $19.99 full price.
* It works as well as all others on the market and significantly better than all of the other $20 to $30 options and it performs as well as the $50-$60 electric fillet knives on the market.
* Academy stands behind any product with the Tournament Choice name on it (their store brand). I don’t abuse the fact that they do this but on occassion I’ll have a knife that only lasts a couple of days. I take it back and they make it right!
* It accepts the Mister Twister Fillet Knife Blades. That’s important. Keep reading and I’ll explain why.

Mister Twister 9” Electric Fillet Knife Blades

Mister Twister Electric Knife BladesThe #1 requirement on my list for
an electric fillet knife is that it must work with the Mister Twister
9” Electric Fillet Knife Blades.

Fillet knife blades have to be replaced often, and these are the best,
and they’re the only replacement blades that are readily available.

The Mister Twister Electric Fillet Knife Blades are super sharp right
out of the package but the main reason they work so well is they’re
much more flexible than most electric fllet knife blades. The ability
to slightly flex the blades while cleaning catfish is essential to the
process I use.

Always make sure you have good sharp knife blades. Dull blades will make
this process much more difficult and will reduce the life of your knife
(and are dangerous as well).  Fillet Knife (Not Electric)

Dexter Russell Fillet Knife

You need a good quality fillet knife. Not
an electric model like previously mentioned, just a good old fashioned
piece of sharpened steel that you’ll power with some elbow grease.

There’s a ton of fillet knives on the market of various quality.

In recent years the Bubbe Blade has been all the rage. I listened to
the Bubba Blade hype for a couple of years and then one of my clients
gave me one. I’m really glad I didn’t spend money on it, it’s
dissapointing at best and certainly not a $50 fillet knife. I really
like the handle but beyond that it’s a major letdown and I’d take
a basic Dexter Russell Fillet Knife over it any day.

If you want an even better quality knife the Cutco Fisherman’s Solution
has a huge following and I’ve never heard anyone say a bad word about
them. They have an almost cult-like following. I’ve simply never used
one because it’s sort of a hassle to get them. Everytime I’ve seen
them in person it’s been at a fair or event and I didn’t want to be
the guy that walks around with a big knife all day.

The fishing has been steady for both walleye and bass. Both species can
be caught on jerk baits with very long pauses when you're retrieving
the bait. Popular baits to use have been smith wick rogues and rapala
shadow raps in shad colors.

Truthfully, I'd say the state record channel cat is swimming in Pueblo
Mark...I don't think very many people target them regularly there. It's
a big lake by Colorado standards with miles of shoreline, timber,
bushes..tons of structure..a lot of it difficult to impossible to fish
effectively. So many places for fish to hide.

The fish I filleted yesterday were all males. Not a bad average size for
males. Strategically, I could see the problem with targeting big fish
in a tourney at Pueblo. As close as the standings were, you get one over
twenty one and it's going in the live well. Your buddy gets another and
you're now just wanting to fill a limit. Shoot, two days of just legal
limits with none over 21 could put you in the money.

Plenty of big fish in Pueblo..but the night bite is better for large fish
..as it is in most lakes. Even with two to three million park visits a
year..the place is deserted at night. Also, once the baby shad move out
into the lake..I think the larger eyes suspend and roam the open water
much like wipers..and just follow the balls of shad ...eating whenever
they please...not really relating to structure.

One hint for anyone looking to target large eyes or cats at Pueblo..Wait
until the baby swallows get ready to fly. It all takes place over a time
span of a week or so..Fish the cliffs under the nests ...a lot of them
don't make a successful flight when they're pushed out of the nest and the
larger cats and eyes are there below the nests looking for an easy meal.
