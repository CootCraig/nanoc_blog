### Application

Simply crank this bait down to the fish holding depth, pause, and watch it
suspend and remain suspended until the tight, tantalizing wobble creates
a vicious strike. The Shallow version suspends in 1 - 8 foot depths,
while the Deep Diver can get down 10 to 20 feet. Excellent for use in
larger lakes, deep weed lines and cover or simply deep trolling.

https://cpw.state.co.us/Documents/Fishing/FisheryWaterSummaries/Summaries/Southeast/PuebloReservoir.pdf

Pueblo has three species of black bass
(largemouth, smallmouth, and spotted).
Numbers of bass in Pueblo Reservoir are
high. 

Walleye, wiper

Pueblo has three species of catfish (channel, flat-
head, and blue)

Pueblo Reservoir also contains fishable populations of black and
white crappie, bluegill, yellow perch and rainbow trout. 


Pueblo has three species of catfish (channel, flat-
head, and blue). Numbers of catfish in Pueblo
Reservoir have been fairly consistent in recent
years and appeared to be made up of fairly large
fish. A good number of catfish over 18” can be
caught. Blue catfish, primarily discontinued
from the stocking schedule due to poor sur-
vival, were stocked in 2013 as extra fish were
available. Blue catfish are rare, but the possi-
bility of catching one and making a new state
record is possible. Channel catfish have been
more abundant than flathead catfish, but the
number of flatheads has increased in recent
years, which will make for another state re-
cord possibility. The state record Flathead
Catfish and Blue Catfish have both come from
Pueblo Reservoir.
In 2014, catch rates for catfish will likely be
decent, especially if you target them. The
quality of fish could be very high. 


The 18” and over size group
was larger than recent years but still relatively small. Gill-
net samples do not do a good job of assessing the status of
larger walleye in the reservoir. These larger fish are present
in the reservoir in good numbers but
are difficult to catch, especially when
gizzard shad are numerous. Average
catches of walleye in Pueblo Reser-
voir yields around 3 to 7 legal fish per
100 fish caught. 2013 was a banner
year for legal walleye, and 2014
should be very similar

The highest catch rates for walleye
will usually occur from mid
May to
the end of June. At this time the fish
will be located on the flats and points
in shallow water and will be feeding
heavily. Anglers looking for larger
fish should use larger baits and move
away from the large schools of small
fish. Catch rates will be significantly
lower, but quality of fish will be sig-
nificantly higher

Since 1960, a history of developing and marketing innovative fish &
game technology.

Vektor™ Fish & Game Forecasts' roots go back to 1960 when John Uldrich
and Robert Knutson, both avid hunters and fishermen from Little Falls,
Minnesota, founded Vexilar Engineering Inc. Their first product in
the fishing arena was the Deptherm™ - a unique and simple tool for
finding depth and temperature. Still in production by Vexilar Inc.,
over a million of these units have been sold. In 1965 they acquired an
electronic temperature sensing device from Honeywell Inc. which also
served as a depth finder. No longer in production, it did put Vexilar
into the electronics sector relating to fishing and opened the door to
sonar equipment which they first imported from Japan.

Pioneering high-resolution, solid state fish location display technology.

By 1968 Uldrich and Knutson were designing and producing leading
edge sonar equipment, pioneering the use of ‘sound’ in sonar,
liquid crystal displays and light emitting diodes for display purposes
(LEDs). They were the first to offer high resolution solid state displays
(Video Sonar™) which are now the standard of the industry.

They continued to research the impact of temperature on fish feeding and
migration patterns and collaborated with the magazine called “Fishing
World” for many years on this subject. Click here to see the current
temperature chart.

As president of Vexilar Inc., Uldrich was inducted into the original
Fishing Hall of Fame for his work on fish temperature correlations and his
effort to use advanced technology in the development of fishing finding
equipment. Vexilar, under Uldrich’s presidency, pioneered the use of
existing sonar for recovery work by Law Enforcement officers and agencies.

Fish & Game Forecast Begins.

In 1973, Vexilar took on the project of marketing a Fish & Game Forecast
service offered by DataSport, then of Minneapolis. When the two partners
sold the company (Vexilar) in 1980, John Uldrich formed Vektor™ to
continue the fish and game services under that name. The use of NOAA
data took place at this time and continues to this day.

Vexilar is a Latin term meaning “a soldier on the leading edge” and
“Vektor” was used in the forecast service because the NOAA formula
relies exclusively on the use of the 37-constituent forces which drive
our planetary system thus creating the tide predicting data. This is
based on the mathematics of “Vector Analysis” – hence “Vektor”.

Vexilar 104 Deptherm

We at Vexilar have a long and proud history of innovation in fishing
products. Lets take a look at who we are and where we came from. Vexilar
has been in the marine business since 1960. We have always been a small
company with good hard working employees. Our goal has simply been to
offer the sportsman innovative and quality products at affordable prices.

Our first product was a small clear tube that, when lowered
under the surface of the water, gave the depth that it was
lowered to. It also gave the temperature of the water at that
depth. The product was the model 104 Deptherm and it is still
in our product line today, over 50+ years later. - See more at:
http://www.vexilar.com/pages/the-history#sthash.EAWWX5ON.dpuf

The fishing odds are on your side every time you go out with a Deptherm,
model 104, for two simple but important reasons. It tells you quickly and
accurately what temperatures are below your boat and it also tells you
how deep these temperature ranges go. Thus, if you have the temperature
chart, you quickly know whether you're fishing in a spot where the fish
are most apt to be. If your Deptherm shows the water too cold or too
warm for the species you're after, you can quickly move just as the fish
do. You won't be wasting the day in the wrong place.

Deptherm works like this: dropped on a line, growing pressure forces water
into the tube as the instrument descends. The volume of water trapped in
the tube serves as a depth measurement column and is read off the side
of the tube calibrated in feet. The thermometer on the other side assures
close temperature readings if the instrument is left down for 30 seconds.

General Application - Attach the Deptherm to line and let sink to bottom
or any intermediate depth. Hold there for 30 seconds and return to
surface. Read depth on the calibrated side at the top of the water column
and temperature off the temperature plate. Invert instruments; press
valve to release water. Shake until all water is out before using again.

Downrigger Application - Clip the Deptherm Model 104 to your
downrigger ball for monitoring water temperature and depth at the
downrigger. When raising the ball for re-rigging, check the temperature
and depth. Temperature readings on the Deptherm will not change while
ball is being raised due to a delayed reaction (1 to 2 minutes).

Electric Fillet Knife

Academy Tournament Choice KnifeI finally settled on the Academy Tournament
Choice Electric Fillet Knife.

There’s nothing special about it, it’s not as powerful as my beloved
MT3, it won’t last for extended periods of time under heavy use (for a
weekend angler you’ll get a lot of life out of it) and there’s really
no “wow factor” at but in a slough of mediocre electric fillet knives
it’s the best!

That’s not a knock on Academy. I love their store and they make good
products. Judging from all of the products on the market, it’s hard
to build an amazing product when it comes to electric fillet knives.

http://www.academy.com/shop/pdp/tournament-choice-electric-fillet-knife/pid-1000662

Here’s why I’m using the Academy Tournament Choice Electric Fillet
Knife:

* It’s cheap at a whopping $19.99 full price.
* It works as well as all others on the market and significantly better than all of the other $20 to $30 options and it performs as well as the $50-$60 electric fillet knives on the market.
* Academy stands behind any product with the Tournament Choice name on it (their store brand). I don’t abuse the fact that they do this but on occassion I’ll have a knife that only lasts a couple of days. I take it back and they make it right!
* It accepts the Mister Twister Fillet Knife Blades. That’s important. Keep reading and I’ll explain why.

Mister Twister 9” Electric Fillet Knife Blades

Mister Twister Electric Knife BladesThe #1 requirement on my list for
an electric fillet knife is that it must work with the Mister Twister
9” Electric Fillet Knife Blades.

Fillet knife blades have to be replaced often, and these are the best,
and they’re the only replacement blades that are readily available.

The Mister Twister Electric Fillet Knife Blades are super sharp right
out of the package but the main reason they work so well is they’re
much more flexible than most electric fllet knife blades. The ability
to slightly flex the blades while cleaning catfish is essential to the
process I use.

Always make sure you have good sharp knife blades. Dull blades will make
this process much more difficult and will reduce the life of your knife
(and are dangerous as well).  Fillet Knife (Not Electric)

Dexter Russell Fillet Knife

You need a good quality fillet knife. Not
an electric model like previously mentioned, just a good old fashioned
piece of sharpened steel that you’ll power with some elbow grease.

There’s a ton of fillet knives on the market of various quality.

In recent years the Bubbe Blade has been all the rage. I listened to
the Bubba Blade hype for a couple of years and then one of my clients
gave me one. I’m really glad I didn’t spend money on it, it’s
dissapointing at best and certainly not a $50 fillet knife. I really
like the handle but beyond that it’s a major letdown and I’d take
a basic Dexter Russell Fillet Knife over it any day.

If you want an even better quality knife the Cutco Fisherman’s Solution
has a huge following and I’ve never heard anyone say a bad word about
them. They have an almost cult-like following. I’ve simply never used
one because it’s sort of a hassle to get them. Everytime I’ve seen
them in person it’s been at a fair or event and I didn’t want to be
the guy that walks around with a big knife all day.

How To Clean a Catfish In Fifteen Seconds, Step By Step

This process is for smaller catfish. I don’t keep bigger catfish,
in fact I’ve recently changed my catch and release policy from ten
pounds to five and always encourage others to put the big cats back.

The techniques not nearly as easy on a larger catfish between five
and ten pounds and it’s also much harder on knives, especially the
electric models.

Truthfully, I'd say the state record channel cat is swimming in Pueblo
Mark...I don't think very many people target them regularly there. It's
a big lake by Colorado standards with miles of shoreline, timber,
bushes..tons of structure..a lot of it difficult to impossible to fish
effectively. So many places for fish to hide.

The fish I filleted yesterday were all males. Not a bad average size for
males. Strategically, I could see the problem with targeting big fish
in a tourney at Pueblo. As close as the standings were, you get one over
twenty one and it's going in the live well. Your buddy gets another and
you're now just wanting to fill a limit. Shoot, two days of just legal
limits with none over 21 could put you in the money.

Plenty of big fish in Pueblo..but the night bite is better for large fish
..as it is in most lakes. Even with two to three million park visits a
year..the place is deserted at night. Also, once the baby shad move out
into the lake..I think the larger eyes suspend and roam the open water
much like wipers..and just follow the balls of shad ...eating whenever
they please...not really relating to structure.

One hint for anyone looking to target large eyes or cats at Pueblo..Wait
until the baby swallows get ready to fly. It all takes place over a time
span of a week or so..Fish the cliffs under the nests ...a lot of them
don't make a successful flight when they're pushed out of the nest and the
larger cats and eyes are there below the nests looking for an easy meal.

Ohio angler Robby Robinson has been fine-tuning his reservoir flathead
strategies for more than 30 years on southeastern Ohio waters: Salt Fork,
Tappan, and Clendening reservoirs.

Nebraska Game & Parks Fisheries Outreach Manager Daryl Bauer has
discovered a unique strategy for reservoir flatheads. While shore-casting
for walleyes and wipers, he’s found that wading and casting crankbaits
works well for flatheads.

Tungsten jigs like the Northland Tackle Tungsten Fireball teamed up
with three pound Bionic Flourocarbon is a solid combination.  Another
sometimes overlooked presentation for deep panfish are small spoons like
the Forage Minnow.  On tough bites, the Forage Minnow with a hanging
treble hook can sometimes work better than the small horizontal jigs
often associated with the finesse required to catch fish that are off.
Reason being is that with a tough bite, the fish will suck and spit more
and sometimes bump the wrong end of a jig.

A long-shanked No. 8 or 10 light-wire hook works well for crickets. Insert
the hook point under the insect’s chin, and run the hook through the
center of the body and out the tail. String the bait onto the hook so
it hangs straight and upright.

#### [walleyecentral.com article]( Big Ugly Bottom Bouncers) Spring Fishing Suggestions by Bob Jensen

When walleyes are the quarry before, during, and just after the spawn,
much of the time a jig will be good, and that jig will be even better
when tipped with a minnow.  A three inch minnow is about right this time
of year.  In some lakes fathead minnows will work, but there are lots
of places where a shiner minnow will be far more productive.  Do some
homework to find out if the walleyes in the body of water you’ll be
fishing have a baitfish preference.

A jig with a short-shanked hook will be better in the spring.  Put the
hook in the minnow’s mouth and out the back of the minnow’s head.
Some anglers hook the minnow through the lips, and that works, but
usually nowhere near as well.  First of all, if you’re casting or
working around vegetation and you’re snapping the jig, lip-hooked
minnows get ripped off very easily.  Hook the minnow in the mouth and
out the hard part of their head and they’ll stay on much better.

Just as important though, when you hook the minnow on a short-shanked
hook in the mouth and out the back of the head, it’s a much smaller
presentation, and in the cold water of spring, that smaller presentation
will catch more fish most of the time.

Next consideration:  Lure speed.  Slower moving lures will usually be
better, but that doesn’t mean we’re going to fish slowly, and that
might not make much sense.  Here’s what I mean.

Most fish in the spring want a slower moving bait, but it can take a
long time to work an area if you’re moving the bait slowly.  What has
worked well for me is to start with, for walleyes for instance, an eighth
ounce stand-up Fire-Ball jig.  This jig has the short-shanked hook and
stands up at rest so the fish can see the minnow wiggling.  I work each
retrieve pretty slow, but I don’t fish an area thoroughly until the
fish are located.  Once I catch one, I slow down and work the area hard.
Often, a switch to a sixteenth ounce round-head Fire-Ball will get the
fish to bite even better.

The same thing is true if you’re fishing for crappies with a slip-bobber
set-up.  Work the bait slowly, but the area quickly until you find the
fish, then slow down and really strain the location.

When employing a slow presentation, a light, invisible line is preferred.
Sunline is becoming very popular among anglers who want the best. If
walleyes are your interest, six pound test Super FC Sniper is an
outstanding fluorocarbon that is as invisible and sensitive as it gets.
If you prefer monofilament, Super Natural in six pound test for walleyes
and four pound test for crappies will excel.



#### [walleyecentral.com article](http://www.walleyecentral.com/articles/?a=3809) Big Water Panfish by Ted Pilgrim

Especially in sprawling freshwater environs, sunfish and crappies tend
to be homebodies, haunting relatively confined zones throughout the
calendar year. No matter how big, deep or intimidating a water body,
most contain prime shallow habitat used by panfish: boat harbors, marinas
and other manmade backwater locales, plus natural bays, coves and creek
inlets. Beginning in spring, nothing could be simpler than laying out
a lake map and red X’ing vast portions of water in the main lake,
particularly the stuff deeper than about 10 feet. Usually, what you’re
left with is 5-percent of the lake’s area—the good stuff near shore
that always holds panfish.

Searching for Sunfish

spring crappieBest known for his success in bigwater bass tournaments,
Joe Balog is also a confirmed panfish sneak, hunting shallow habitats from
ice-out in March all the way through summer. A resident of Michigan’s
Lake St. Clair—which lies between lakes Erie and Huron and encompasses
430 square miles—Balog loves chasing springtime pumpkinseeds. An
intriguing, exotically beautiful member of the sunfish clan, ‘seeds,
says Balog, are a bigtime mussel eater that spawn on hard bottom,
often near mussel beds. “Pumpkinseeds possess unique grinders in their
throat that give them the ability to dine effortlessly on zebra mussels,
crayfish and other invertebrates,” he says. “What’s neat is that
on a lake like St. Clair, you’ve got real confined shallow bays that
possess both hard-bottom and pondweed (cabbage). So I can take a giant
lake and quickly narrow it down to just a few dozen acres—spots easily
discerned on a LakeMaster digital map. The fish will often linger in
these zones, spring through summer.

“Some of my favorite spring fishing occurs on warm, mostly calm days
when you can get out and sunglass the water while cruising around
with the Minn Kota. Because the fish often bunch into little areas
like a 6-foot by 6-foot patch of cabbage, it’s real easy to miss
‘em. So it’s probably some of the most weather-dependent fishing
I do all year. Certainly, you can get out on cloudy or windy days, and
search. But then, it’s a matter of using my Humminbird side imaging
to canvas these flats and look for both weed patches and small pods of
panfish on screen. Once they begin spawning, I can even spot the beds
right on my Onix unit, which is a huge advantage.”

On his favorite warm spring days, Balog relishes pitching small 1/32-ounce
tube jigs and Beetle Spins into pockets in the vegetation, or along subtle
transitions, such as a 3 to 5 foot break where mussels and crayfish often
cluster together between the weeds and hard bottom, right on that little
edge. The Beetle Spin, Balog says, shines as a search tool.

Once fish reveal themselves, working them over with tiny plastics,
such as a Custom Jigs & Spins Finesse Plastic or Wedgee—either on a
light jig or beneath a slip float—yields fast action. Balog wields an
ultralight 6-foot Daiwa Presso rod with 4-pound test mono for most of
his ‘seed fishing. Likewise, St. Croix’s Panfish Series rods have
also proven themselves as “new classic” sunfish sticks.

Wolfpacks of Perch

While sunfish and crappies are comfortable hanging around
relatively small home ranges, yellow perch often range much further,
season-to-season. Balog finds small pods of big perch, some upwards of
14 inches, roving through shallow bulrushes and pencil reeds, rooted on
hard bottom flats. The move usually occurs in postspawn—from late May
into June—on many inland lakes, including St. Clair. A similar pattern
also occurs in late summer into early fall, when perch return to shallow
bulrush flats.

Bass anglers frequently collide with big perch while throwing
spinnerbaits, as well as plastic worms. “These fish are super
aggressive,” says Balog. “Finding them is the biggest obstacle,
but by fishing fast with Beetle Spins, small plastics or even cranks,
the fish actually tend to find you pretty quick. Once or so each spring,
you get one of those days when the system clicks on all cylinders, and
you connect with beautiful pound-plus panfish of all three species. Big
water. Big fish. A ton of fun.”



#### [walleyecentral.com article](http://www.walleyecentral.com/articles/?a=3730) Dropshot Panfish by Ted Pilgrim

The Best Rig You’ve Never Fished?

By Ted Pilgrim with Brian “Bro” Brosdahl

Amazing that such a versatile rig— this prefect presenter of soft
plastics and livebait— would be so little employed by panfish fans. In
reality, a dropshot rig can be as productive as a bobber and bait, or
even a tiny jig. It’s even possible that the dropshot is the most
versatile rig of all, providing instant depth control; fishes heavy
without impairing or impeding the presentation; shines in shallow and
deep water; and activates softbaits like no other presentation.

Despite the rig’s “advanced” connotation, the dropshot couldn’t be
simpler. Think split-shot rig in reverse. As a softbait delivery method,
the dropshot excels for bass. So it’s no surprise that small baits
twitched and wiggled in new and tantalizing ways hold equal appeal for
crappies, sunfish and big perch. If you can cast, you’re in. If you
can tie a Palomar knot, you can master a dropshot rig.

Dropshot Baits

dropshot panfishTons of small softbaits now give panfish angler’s
an arsenal of sweet options. Yet, while shapes like twister tail grubs
excel on a jig, a dropshot activates straight tail worms, minnows and
other subtle shapes. Moreover, many classic softbait shapes traditionally
threaded onto 1/8 to 1/64-ounce jigheads spring to new life when pinned
to a plain hook above a sinker.

Consider the Custom Jigs & Spins Wedgee, a lively microbait “twitcher”
that marries perfectly with a dropshot. Impaled onto a #10 or #12
short-shank hook above a dropshot sinker, the Wedgee and other wispy
sliver-tail baits can be almost magic for palm-stretching pans. Deployed
with a ¼- to 3/8-ounce weight, these tiny morsels move with spellbinding
action. Other microbaits like Custom Jigs & Spins Finesse Plastics and
Noodel and Northland Tackle’s Impulse Bro Bloodworm perform truly
captivating dropshot dances.

Anything with nice soft appendages and a fine quivering tail is a
potentially perfect dropshot enticement. So long as you can nose hook
it on a #6 to a #12 fine-wire hook, such as an Eagle Claw L2B, nearly
any miniature morsel can be made to tempt bites, including livebait.

“Any time I need to put a bait at an exact level and keep it in the
fish’s face,” contends guide and panfish pioneer Brian “Bro”
Brosdahl, “a dropshot is priceless. Not only can I cast a dropshot
and simply twitch it in place, I can also drag the rig, swim it, troll
it or even work it vertically beneath the boat or a hole in the ice.”

As with any presentation, of course, limitations exist. Shallow
dense cover areas, such as thick vegetation or brush are largely
off limits. Fish suspended higher than three feet above bottom are
also better served with other approaches. But even this situation has
exceptions. When crappies or sunfish suspend in treetops or sparse brush
deep enough to fish vertically beneath your boat, a dropshot can be the
perfect presentation.

Rigging the Drop

Based on countless cover, depth and other conditions, a well-armed
dropshot can be built with an array of possible componentry. “To detect
bites,” says Bro, “I use a 4- to 8-pound test braided mainline,
joining it to an 18- to 36-inch section of mono or fluorocarbon, using
back-to-back Uni knots or an Improved Albright knot.” Often, when
hunting fish within a foot of bottom, Bro says, an 18-inch length of 4-
to 6- pound test mono is perfect.

The most critical aspect of the dropshot is tying the Palomar knot so
the hookpoint faces up. Bro interjects that an exception to the standard
dropshot rig often becomes necessary with light biting fish. “Big
bluegills often mouth a softbait like humans taste red hot food. So
it’s sometimes best to rig with a short dropper, or pair of droppers
jutting from the mainline, as opposed to pinning the bait to the line
with a Palomar.” Beyond the obvious advantage of allowing fish to more
easily flush a bait entirely into its craw—thanks to the semi-slack
dropper line—Bro also extols the ‘flutter factor.’

“Once the sinker hits bottom,” he says, “a short 3- to 8- inch
dropper gives your bait a nice fluttering effect—more movement—as the
dropper and bait slowly descend to catch up. I also like that a dropper
gives baits a little extra whipping action when you move the rod-tip.”

Situational Droppin’

“Best rig there is for fishing just inches above low growing grass or
small rocks, keeping a bait clean and at eye-level with the fish,” Bro
asserts. “With a ¼-ounce sinker and 4-pound test, I can even get down
to 20 feet of water fast, and fish with finesse and precision.

“In flooded trees and bushes, I’ll position my boat directly above
a school of fish, and slide the rig down to a certain level—tops of
the trees or mere inches above the level of fish I’m marking on the
Humminbird. With Spot-Lock engaged on my iPilot, I’ll hover directly
above and simply shake the rod tip to activate the bait’s tiny tail. The
control you have with this presentation is unbelievable.”

For casting to shallow spring panfish, a dropshot can be powerful
medicine. “Fish that have just moved up onto shallow flats aren’t
real active yet. I use a 7-foot St. Croix Panfish Series rod to pitch a
compact dropshot rig past the fish and slowly work it into position. Once
there, give the rod-tip periodic nervous shakes, so the sinker stays put,
but the bait’s little tail quivers like a defenseless invertebrate,
inches above bottom.

“A dropshot is absolutely beautiful for putting a bait at the fish’s
eye level—right where they’ve got no choice but to eat it.”



#### [walleyecentral.com article](http://www.walleyecentral.com/articles/?a=3473) Keep It Simple For More Fish by Bob Jensen

Fishing is different things to different people.  Some folks like to
consider every aspect of why a fish was caught on a certain bait, was
in a particular location at that time, and why that fish decided to
bite just then.  That’s great.  Curious anglers catch lots of fish
and often are the leaders in fishing education.

summer bassOther anglers just want to go fishing.  They don’t want to
analyze why they caught a fish, they just want to catch’em.  That’s
great too.  If these folks were a little more interested in why they’re
catching fish the way they’re catching them, they would probably catch
more fish, but again, fishing is different things to different people.

Sometimes a simple approach to fishing is the most productive.  I’ve
been reminded of that fact several times this summer.  Just recently,
in the heat of the summer, a simple presentation was responsible for an
outstanding walleye catch.

We were on a large Midwest lake known for walleyes.  It could have been
one of hundreds of bodies of water.  The walleyes were on rock humps in
depths from nine to thirteen feet.  We chose to employ a very simple rig.
After anchoring just upwind and to the side of the hump, we tied a hook
to our line and crimped a medium sized splitshot onto the line above
the hook about eighteen inches.  We added a leech to the hook, cast
to the hump, and reeled back in slowly, giving the rig lots of stops
along the way.  Every five or ten minutes we’d catch a nice walleye.
Pretty simple stuff.  We did add one twist to the rig.  The hook had to
be a Northland Super-Glo Attractor Hook in either orange or chartreuse.
That’s as fancy as we got, and we caught lots of fish.

We noticed other boats working similar humps close to us.  They were
backtrolling and front trolling with crankbaits and spinners and all sorts
of other rigs.  They weren’t catching much though.  That’s probably
because their baits were in and out of the fish zone all the time.
Our baits, due to our anchored position, were always in the fish zone,
and that makes it much more likely that you’re going to get bit.

Simple doesn’t mean primitive.  We relied on the sonar in our boat
to find the best spots.  Without sonar, we wouldn’t have been nearly
as successful.  In fact, we probably wouldn’t have found the spots
that we fished.  Still, you don’t need sonar with all the gadgets
to find the fish.  There are lots of times when all the new technology
built into modern sonar units will help you catch more fish, but it’s
up to the individual angler how far they want to go with technology.

And, there are times when, if you want to catch more and bigger fish,
you will need more than a hook and a splitshot.  That’s the fun part
of fishing:  You can make it whatever you want it to be.  Sometimes I
like simple, sometimes I like the more high-tech stuff.  As long as
you’re enjoying your time on the water, you’re fishing the right way.

Bottom bouncers are the solution to presenting livebait at a steady pace
a scant few inches above snaggy bottoms, flats, or open basins.

Three-way rigs once were considered a simplistic alternative to more
refined slip-sinker rigs. But past misconceptions regarding their limited
adaptability and use have been washed away on a tide of productivity. They
catch walleyes in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs; along structure
and across open basins; and now more than ever before, at different
depths. Livebait, plastics, crankbaits, floating jigheads, spinners,
flutter spoons, and combinations thereof follow the three-way lead. Take
advantage of this versatile rigging system, or you’re missing fish.

Drop shot rigs have been used years by anglers seeking a variety of fish
species. I have found it to be a very useful technique for bluegill
fishing, especially when they retreat to the depths in the summer and
winter months. It allows for maximal control for a presentation that is
typically slower moving or completely still.

The classic drop shot rig is a hook or jig tied onto the line with a
Palmor knot that has a long tag end remaining. A video of the Palmor
knot can be found at the bottom of the page should you need a refresher
or have never used this knot before. A weight is then attached to this
tag end at the depth past the bait that you wish it to suspend from
the bottom. Let the line down until you feel the weight encounter the
bottom. Keep the lure there or impart action by jigging or swimming it
around that location.

The bait or lure used with this presentation is almost endless. Simple
hooks with soft plastic bodies, hand ties flies, live baits, something
from the Gulp Alive line, and so on. Change the lure offering, color and
presentation until you dial in the bite and start loading your bucket
with bluegill the size of your head. But pay close attention to your
line as bluegill will sometimes strike while moving up which is only
indicated by a slack line.

#### [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7ONlnmSSEs) Best Fish Filleting Method 

A relatively simple and efficient way to fillet a standard fish. No
scaling, gutting or cutting off the head. Boneless, skinless fillets are
the end result, and a nearly meatless carcass. It takes some practice to
get good at this technique, but it's worth it once you do. You have to
modify the procedure for walleye and catfish because they have a different
head shape. See my other videos to use this method on largemouth bass
and catfish.

Yes, I know this video shows two left sides being filleted. None of
the right sides I filmed turned out because my shoulder was in the
way. The point was to show a second side being done because it is a
little different, not being supported by the meat on the other side.

If you want to leave the skin on, scale the fish first, then cut through
the tail on the fourth cut.
