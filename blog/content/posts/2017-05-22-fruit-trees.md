  Black Twig
</h2>

Black Twig, an old Tennessee variety with a dark burgundy skin, was Andrew
Jackson's favorite apple. It was introduced about 1830 as a seedling on
the farm of Major Rankin Toole near Fayetteville, Tennessee. It became
one of the popular dessert varieties in the 19th and early 20th century
in Central Virginia orchards. It is not ripe until October, has a very
crisp flesh that is both sweet and tart, and it gets better the longer
you keep it--if cared for properly--almost until Spring.
