they are built out of a three-phase induction motor or generator,
called an idler, on which two of the terminals (the idler inputs)
are powered from the single phase line. The rotating flux in the motor
produces a voltage on the third terminal. A voltage is induced in the
third terminal that is shifted by 120° from the voltage between the
first two terminals. In a three-winding motor, two of the windings are
acting as a motor, and the third winding is acting as a generator.

Phase converters are our only business. We are true specialists. We
do not engage in any activity that would divert our attention from the
serious business of helping our customers operate three-phase equipment
from a single-phase source.

The Phasemaster® three-phase  converter is the oldest commercial rotary
converter in existence. Its original patents were issued in 1963 and it
has the longest continuous field service record of any phase converter
brand on the market

The best engineered, most reliable Rotary Phase Converter you can buy.

Whether you need to power an air compressor, a woodworking shop,
or a laser, you'll find the Phasemaster® Type MA rotary three phase
converter up to the task. This general-purpose rotary phase converter
is a reliable source of true three-phase power. When connected to a 230
volt 1-phase line, the Type MA phase converter produces 3-phase power
at its output terminals with each phase shifted 120°. You get a near
replica of utility 3-phase power-more economically.

Use our sizing charts to determine which Type MA phase converter is right
for your application. Remember, however, that the most important factor
in proper sizing is the application for which your motor is used. The MA
phase converter is available in 3 standard configurations. The MA, the
MA-A with automatic controls, and the MA-R with a built in disconnect
switch. Look at our application guide to find out which model is best
for your application, take a look at the product literature, or contact
us for assistance.

A rotary converter, which looks like a heavy-duty electric motor with
an over-sized junction box attached, functions as both a motor and
a generator. As a rotary converter is spun by single-phase power, it
generates three-phase power to run other machines. More expensive than
a static converter, a rotary converter costs around $600 for a 3-hp unit
but doesn't have the starting and reduced-power problems that occur with
a static converter. If you expect to own several three-phase machines,
buy a good-sized rotary converter, which will be more economical in the
long run.
