<pre>
1:00 - Automatic ignition
1:45 - stove gets a call from the thermostat
       timers run stove until it reaches a certain temperature
       stays running by temperature and thermostat demand
       returns to times for shutdown
       red call light shows demand for heat.
2:08   thermostat calls for heat.  The call light (red) comes on.
2:15 - exhaust blower comes on creating a partial vacuum in the burn-pot
       the feed motor starts and feeds a few pellets
       the ignitor comes on
       a low flame sends reading of 200deg. to the control box
       if this happens within 2 minutes the ignitor will turn off
       and the feed motor will continue to turn
       if 200deg. is not reached the feed motor will stop
       but the igniter will stay on for four more minutes
       green light comes on at 200deg. red light at 1000deg.
3:40 - the shutdown sequence is also timed.
       thermostat call goes off, red light goes off, shutdown sequence started
       the feed motor stops
       exhaust blower runs for 8 minutes, exhausting the remaining fuel in the fire-pot
       the exhaust fan shuts off until the thermostat calls for heat.
4:10 - convection blowers move air over the heat exchanger.
       turn on at 125deg. turn off at 105deg.
4:40 - also 3 safety systems.
       vacuum switch turns of feed motor if door is open or exhaust is clogged

13:55  restart button is beside the call light 
       when pushed, opens the thermostat circuit
       when released it restarts the automatic ignition cycle
       this only works when the thermostat is calling for heat
15:00  system pull pellets up the feed tube from the hopper
       and drops them down the feed chute into the fire-pot
15:30  fire-pot is made of cast ceramic
       designed with air intake holes that swirl the fire
       when there is fire in the pot, air from bottom causes cyclone of air
       a removable clean-outplug was designed into the fire-pot
16:11  The igniter is made of cast silicon carbide ceramic material
       reaches 2500deg.

        adjust air adjustment plate
28:54 - shows properly adjust flame - short and active
29:03 - fire is too small
        open feed adjustment plate.
        if needed close the air adjustment
29:43 - if glass is getting black, fire is probably too high
30:21 - hard wood has high minerals, will generate clinkers
31:04 - buy pellets in muti-ton lots when possible
31:20 - troubleshooting
        what shut the stove off?
        assume the thermostat is calling for heat ahd the red call light is on.
31:44 - look in the fire-pot to see
31:50 - unburned pellets, stove has simply missed an ignition

38:29 - no cleaning of the igniter is necessary
38:49 - small convection blower checked and cleaned every 6 months
39:05 - large convection blower cleaned once a year
39:20 - clean the exhaust stack
39:50 - parts replacement
        the call light is a 28 volt AC bulb number 85 lamp if replacement is necessary remove
        24V AC thermostat. .05 amp heat anticipator
41:15 - snap disk #1. marked F125-20
42:00 - snap disk #2. makred L250-40
        opens at 250deg. resets when it cools down
        test by shorting
42:35 - snap disk #3. marked L200-M
        rarely needs replacing. all power goes through it
43:25 - convection blower #1 42cfm
44:30 - convection blower #2 86cfm

<h2>November 2017 Troubleshooting</h2>

Problem: Fire does not start.

Symptom: Exhaust blower does not run.

<h4>Blower #2 - Negative Draft Blower</h4>

User manual p.1614 Blower #2 (Negative Draft Blower)

This blower creates a negative pressure (vacuum) in the
firebox. It extracts all of the exhaust out of the firebox and
sends it into the venting system. The blower is located on the
left side of the insert. When the insert is pulled out onto the
hearth, the blower is accessible through a removable access
panel.

</h4>p13.4 VENTING SYSTEM</h4>

The venting system should be inspected and cleaned at least once a year,
or more often depending upon the quality of your fuel.  If you are
experiencing nuisance shutdowns, check for a clogged exhaust system. If
the exhaust is restricted, the vacuum safety switch will shut the feed
motor off (the red light will remain on). You can clean the venting
system without removing it from the insert by opening the small hinged
access door, located on top of the exhaust blower housing. Using a small
vacuum attachment, vacuum the exhaust housing

<h4>p13.6 - BLOWERS</h4>

There are three blowers in this insert:  an exhaust blower that evacuates
the exhaust out of the firebox, and two convection air blowers that
delivers heat into the room.  THESE BLOWERS REQUIRE NO LUBRICATION.

A.  The exhaust blower is located at the left rear side of the insert.
It should be inspected during the annual cleaning of the exhaust
system. The exhaust blower impellers can be inspected periodically by
using the exhaust blower cleanout door.

B.  The larger convection blower is located on the front left side of the
insert, and is accessible by removing the front left panel.  The impeller
on this blower should be cleaned at least once a year. You can do this
without removing the blower. Simply brush and vacuum the impeller area.

C.  The small convection blower is located at the rear right side of the
insert. When the insert is pulled out onto the hearth, it is accessible
through a removable access panel. The impeller on this blower should
also be cleaned at least once a year, and can also be cleaned in place.
