We must now consider the longest and most desperate of Charlemagne's
wars—that waged against the Saxons, which began before his campaign
against Desiderius and lasted not less than thirty-three years.

A bitter race antagonism had long prevailed between the Franks and
the Saxons. As already related, the latter had been subjugated by
Charlemagne's predecessors and forced to pay tribute. Saxony extended
along both sides of the Weser, westerly to the vicinity of the lower
Rhine, southwesterly to the Harz and the Unstrut, and northerly to the
ocean, except the country occupied by the Frisians. Four races inhabited
Saxony—the Westphalians, living between the Weser and the Issel; the
Eastphalians, on the right bank of the Weser to the Elbe; the Eugen,
between both these; and the Northmen, or Nordalbingi, who lived on both
sides of the Elbe. "Phalen" or "Falen" means a great plain, and one of
these names (Westphalia) is in use to-day.

# Charlemagne

<a href="http://www.history.com/topics/charlemagne" target="_blank">history.com Charlemagne</a>

Charlemagne (c.742-814), also known as Karl and Charles the Great, was a
medieval emperor who ruled much of Western Europe from 768 to 814. In 771,
Charlemagne became king of the Franks, a Germanic tribe in present-day
Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and western Germany. He
embarked on a mission to unite all Germanic peoples into one kingdom,
and convert his subjects to Christianity. A skilled military strategist,
he spent much of his reign engaged in warfare in order to accomplish
his goals. In 800, Pope Leo III (750-816) crowned Charlemagne emperor
of the Romans. In this role, he encouraged the Carolingian Renaissance,
a cultural and intellectual revival in Europe. When he died in 814,
Charlemagne’s empire encompassed much of Western Europe, and he had
also ensured the survival of Christianity in the West. Today, Charlemagne
is referred to by some as the father of Europe.
