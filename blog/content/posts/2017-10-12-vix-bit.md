  40050 – 5 Piece Self-Centering Hinge Bit Set
</h4>

<h4>You will be happy with this set. By Gary C. Ruisinger</h4>

I have had three different sets of hinge drilling bits. These are by
far the best set, period. Very smooth drilling because the chips clear
great. Most other sets have a single small hole for chips, these have
two generous slots. The sliding guide is a good fit in the body and so
far I have not had it stick in the up position or had to clear chips
to keep working. These do exactly what they are supposed to do with no
fuss. No storage box, just a clamshell package is the only downside.

<h4>My "Go-To" for cordless or drill press. By BSlug205</h4>

My "Go-To" bits especially for countersinking. Hoping to find one size
bigger countersink bit to add to it but meanwhile, overall it seems to
be good quality set of bits.

<h4>Never going back to hanging hinges without this set.  By michael peterson</h4>

Made the job much faster and for a cleaner install. Product is very
high quality. Hinges and drawer pulls stayed in place allowing for an
exact layout. I used with my impact drill and it worked well with this
setup. I ended up purchasing a 25 piece multpiece set from Snappy also
I was so pleased with this.
