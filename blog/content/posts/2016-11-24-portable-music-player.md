Here you'll find all mobile players known to natively support Vorbis.

When updating this information, please consider these guidelines: Use the
term Vorbis not OGG (Ogg is the container format, Vorbis is the codec
name). Add information about other Xiph-codecs such as Speex, FLAC,
and Theora. Do not add information about non-Xiph-codecs such as MP3,
WMA, or WAV.

Bin Liang, CEO of Zhu Spark Electronic Equipment Co., Ltd., parent
company of Cayin, said “We have packed our class leading digital
audio technologies into a very compact package. The new DAP is designed
around the AK4490EN DAC chipset from AKM. It will support all common
digital music format upto 24Bits/192kHz or native decode DSD up to
11.2Mhz (DSD256). The N3 can work as a USB-DAC to achieve high quality,
high resolution audio from your desktop computer or laptop, and it can
also serve as digital transport to external DAC, outputting PCM and DoP
bit-stream through our unique dual digital output (Coaxial and USB-Audio)
via USB Type-C connection.”

The N3 is Cayin's new entry-level DAP. It's packed with an AKM4490 DAC,
which is one of my favorite DACs right now. Compared to the N5 (which
is one of my go-to DAPs), the N3 is 40% smaller and 50% lighter. It's
rated for 12 hours continuous playback, so the N3 is set to make it
through long days of listening to your favorite music. The N3 supports
all common digital music formats up to 24Bits/192kHz, natively decodes
DSD up to DSD256, and outputs PCM and DoP to external DACs through a
unique dual digital output (Coaxial and USB-Audio via USB Type-C). With
Bluetooth v4.0 and apt-X, the N3 can go wireless with latest Bluetooth
speakers and headphones, making the most versatile Cayin N series DAP
yet. In short, I think it's going to be quite the versatile piece of
audio kit to have around!
