For this authorization, 23andMe conducted extensive validation studies
for accuracy and user comprehension that met FDA standards.23andMe is now
the only company authorized by the FDA to provide personal genetic health
risk reports without a prescription. These reports provide individuals
with information about genetic variants that could increase their personal
risk for certain diseases.

Ancestry.com uses Illumina OmniExpress Plus, reporting all SNP's on that
chip for $99. Current users will receive data for about ~47,000 of the
SNPs in SNPedia. ~25,000 of these are in ClinVar.

23andMe $99 "ancestry only" product, is sufficient for Promethease, or
the $199 "ancestry + health" product, which also includes carrier status
reports. One time payment, lifetime membership. Both products use the
(same) customized Illumina chip which covers 27038 of the 107204 SNPs in
SNPedia. Less than 2,000 of these are known to be in ClinVar; presumably
some of the proprietarily named "i-SNPs" correspond to ClinVar/SNPedia
entries as well but 23andMe does not reveal which publicly or to its
non-corporate users.

FamilyTreeDNA Family Finder uses an Illumina OmniExpress for autosomal
ancestry testing for $79, including partial raw data download. It
covers 13,732 of the SNPs in SNPedia, with ~2,000 of those being known
to ClinVar.

<ul>
  <li>The STR-based Y DNA tests such as the Y37, Y67 and Y111 tests, cannot be used with Promethease as they produce no SNP data.</li>
  <li>The "Big Y" Y DNA test produces SNP data (more than 10,000,000 base pairs) that is accepted by Promethease (only the VCF format results, not the much larger BAM file). The "Big Y" test is only available to those who have already done STR-based Y DNA testing with FamilyTreeDNA.</li>
  <li>Mitochondrial DNA test results (FASTA format) are not accepted by Promethease.</li>

<h4>Methylation Analysis</h4>

This website looks at your methylation genetics just by reading your
23andMe raw data. After you receive your results from 23andMe, click
on the Methylation Analysis link, follow the simple instructions, and
you’ll see some of your methylation-related genetic polymorphisms.

Studies have shown that DNA Methylation can be altered with vitamins
such as B12, Folate, SAMe, and other methyl donors.

<h4>Detox Profile</h4>

The detox profile looks at gene SNPs of the Cytochrome P450 detox enzymes,
amongst others. Certain genetic polymorphisms have been shown to impair
detoxification of drugs, hormones, environmental toxins, xenobiotics,
and more.

Simply click on the Detox Profile link, follow the simple instructions
provided on the website, and you’ll see a a list of relevant genetic
polymorphisms.

  You Are Not the Result of Your Genes
</h3>

1209-dnaThe first thing to realize when you are using genetic data is
that you are not the result of your genes (most of the time anyway). You
are the result of your gene expression and heritable changes in your
gene expression. This is also known as epigenetics.

What does this mean? You can’t look at a piece of paper (or a website)
and determine exactly what treatments or supplements you need based on
your genetics. You also have to keep in mind, that there are a lot of
SNPs that we don’t know much about. In fact, there are approximately
23.7 million SNPs identified. Out of these SNPs, only 14.5 million have
been validated. The remaining 9.2 million SNPs are candidate SNPs.

I guess you can say that in terms of genetics, genomics, and SNPs, we
still don’t know a whole lot. We’re understanding what all of this
means a little more each and every day, but it will take many years
until we really know what most of these SNPs truly mean in terms of
human health.

A genetic methylation and detox panel only show you a very small number
of SNPs that have been more or less well studied. We’re limited by
what we know. And we are limited by what we don’t know. These small
sets of SNPs may help give a picture of where to start with things
like nutritional support of the methylation cycle, but these genes do
not not define you. Through testing we can see all these genes, but we
can’t see individual expression of these genes. Your environment and
life experiences can change the expression of your genes at any moment
in your life. For an example, the expression of the MAO-A gene on the
methylation panel can change from serious trauma or violence.
