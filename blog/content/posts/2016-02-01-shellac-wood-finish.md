* 200 Proof Alcohol $12.95 / qt

Highly recommended for thinning Royal-Lac or Seal-Lac or as a shellac
solvent. Our 200 proof alcohol has the most minimal percentage of water
in comparison to store bought denatured alcohol that contain anywhere
between 7-10% water.

The denatured alcohol that we use to manufacture Royal-Lac and Seal-Lac
is what we offer you. If we are satisfied with its quality, you surely
will be to!
