The Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research is part of the
Ben-Gurion University, and is located in the Midreshet Ben-Gurion campus
in the centre of the Negev desert in Israel.

The Institute was established in 1974 as a result of a recommendation made
by the Israeli Council for Higher Education in 1972. It was named as the
Jacob Blaustein Institute for Desert Research in 1980 after a donation
to the university by the Jacob and Hilda Blaustein Foundation. The
name was later changed to the Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert
Research (BIDR), when it was split in three: the Zuckerberg Institute
for Water Research, the French Associates Institute for Agriculture
and Biotechnology of Drylands and the Swiss Institute for Dryland
Environmental and Energy Research.

The BIDR is one of the five faculties of Ben-Gurion University of the
Negev and is currently (June 2015) home to 85 academic, research faculty,
80 technical and administrative staff members, and over 200 Israeli
and foreign research students and 35 post-doctoral fellows studying
within the frame of the Albert Katz International School for Desert
Studies. The prime areas of research are environmental physics, solar
energy, water and waste-water resources, agriculture, biotechnology,
desert ecology and desert architecture.
