<h1>Debian Desktop Notes</h1>

<h2>
  LXDE
  <a href="http://lxde.org/" target="_blank">lxde.org</a>
</h2>

LXDE is designed to work well with computers on the low end of the
performance spectrum such as older resource-constrained machines, new
generation netbooks, and other small computers.

No extra configuration needed for GDM / KDM / LightDM: just simply select
the LXDE option at the login screen menu.

  Mate
  <a href="http://mate-desktop.org/" target="_blank">mate-desktop.org</a>
</h2>

The MATE Desktop Environment is the continuation of GNOME 2. It provides
an intuitive and attractive desktop environment using traditional
metaphors for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.

MATE is under active development to add support for new technologies
while preserving a traditional desktop experience. See the Roadmap The
MATE Manifesto outlines some of the principles that guide the project.

Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment for UNIX-like operating

  <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Xfce" target="_blank">wiki.debian.org/Xfce</a>
</h3>

Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment for Unix-like operating
systems. It aims to be fast and lightweight, while still being visually
appealing and easy to use.

Xfce is based on GTK+ version 2 (like Gnome 2). One of Xfce's
priorities is adherence to standards, specifically those defined
at freedesktop.org. This allows Xfce to seamlessly interoperate with
programs written for other desktop environments, if those programs follow
the specified standards.

Xfce consists of a number of components that together provide the full
functionality of a desktop environment. They are packaged separately
and you can pick and choose from the available packages to create the
best personal working environment.
