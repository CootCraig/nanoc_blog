<h5>Different NPT Fitting Sizes</h5>

1/4" NPT fitting thread

Fitting sizes can be a bit confusing! Do not make the assumption - as
I used to - that a 1/4" NPT fitting thread is anywhere near 1/4 inch in
diameter! Not even close.

Visit your favorite hardware or plumbing store and ask for a 1/4"
fitting. The fitting they will show you will likely be a 1/4" NPT. You
will look at the diameter of the thread and say to yourself, this ain't
no 1/4" fitting. It will be. The actual diameter of the 1/4" NPT thread
will be just over 1/2".

The size of an NPT fitting, teh 1/4", the 3/8", 1/2" and so on are
reference sizes. The actual size of each is much larger than the fraction
size they are supposed to be.

<h5>Well done Milton! - Byaudiophonicshzon May 28, 2015</h5>

These Milton hi-flo fittings are well machined. They supply more air to
your tools and spraying. I purchased these to eek out every last PSI
out of my compressor, 11 gallon air tank combo. I was spraying some
furniture and these fittings definitely help.

<h5>Great!  ByT.G.on March 19, 2014</h5>

Noticeably different hole diameter on these plugs. I havent had any issue
from damage and have had my shop on the Milton V system for a few years
now. A little spendier initial investment but worth it to only do it
once. I recommend getting more of all your fittings than you think you
will need to allow you room to plumb other projects that come up down
the road without having to wait for shipping!
