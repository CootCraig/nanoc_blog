<h5>Well done Milton! - Byaudiophonicshzon May 28, 2015</h5>

These Milton hi-flo fittings are well machined. They supply more air to
your tools and spraying. I purchased these to eek out every last PSI
out of my compressor, 11 gallon air tank combo. I was spraying some
furniture and these fittings definitely help.

<h5>Great!  ByT.G.on March 19, 2014</h5>

Noticeably different hole diameter on these plugs. I havent had any issue
from damage and have had my shop on the Milton V system for a few years
now. A little spendier initial investment but worth it to only do it
once. I recommend getting more of all your fittings than you think you
will need to allow you room to plumb other projects that come up down
the road without having to wait for shipping!
