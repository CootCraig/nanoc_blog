<h3>Netflix Best Overall Streaming Service</h3>

The great-granddaddy of streaming services remains the best. As you
probably know, Netflix provides unlimited streaming of TV shows, movies,
comedy specials and original programming (including Orange Is the New
Black, House of Cards and the fourth season of Arrested Development)
for one monthly subscription fee. No other service has yet given Netflix
an honest-to-goodness run for its money in terms of selection, quality
and performance consistency. You can even create up to five different
profiles on a single account to make sure that your favorite content
doesn't mess up recommendations for your friends and loved ones.

<h3>Hulu: Best Streaming Service for Network TV</h3>

If you want to keep current with the latest TV shows but don't feel
like investing in a cable subscription or an HD antenna, Hulu is the
best solution. This service provides access to most major network shows
(aside from CBS' programs) and a handful of cable shows the day after
they air. It also lets subscribers access a show's current season —
or often all of the program's seasons. In addition, the service hosts a
number of original shows (including joint ventures with the BBC, like
The Wrong Mans and season 4 of The Thick of It), a selection of offbeat
movies and a surprising amount of classic anime series. Even with a paid
subscription, you have to sit through commercials, but far fewer than
if you watched the same shows on cable.

<h3>Amazon Video: Best Streaming Service for Families</h3>

For those who do most of their shopping online, Amazon Prime is a
no-brainer. For $99 per year, you get free two-day shipping on your
purchases, a free Kindle book each month, and unlimited access to both
Amazon Music and Amazon Prime Instant Video. Like Netflix, Amazon
Prime Instant Video is a veritable buffet of movies, television and
original programming, like Alpha House, Transparent and Mozart in the
Jungle. Thanks to a deal with Viacom — which controls Comedy Central,
MTV and Nickelodeon — Amazon Prime arguably has a better selection of
comedy and children's programming than its competitors. The service also
offers unlimited access to an extensive collection from HBO's back catalog
of classics such as The Sopranos and The Wire. The separate Amazon Video
provides easy access to current movies, but it's an à la carte service.

<h3>PlayStation Vue: Best Cable TV Replacement</h3>

PlayStation Vue is about as close as you can get to a cable subscription
without actually getting a cable company involved. The service, which
is available on a wide variety of systems, is Sony's first foray
into delivering live TV to its customers. Choose from four different
packages: Access ($50 per month), which gives you basic channels, Core
($55 per month), which adds sports, Elite ($65 per month), which adds
niche programming and Ultra ($75 per month), which adds certain premium
channels. Although the service is expensive, it provides up to 90 live
channels - including local sports and news - and lets you record your
favorite shows.

<h3>Sling.TV: Best Budget Cable TV Replacement</h3>

If you like the idea of a cable subscription but feel it's just too
expensive and offers more content than you want, Sling TV might provide
a happy medium for you. On paper, Sling sounds a lot like a traditional
cable service: Pay a monthly subscription fee in exchange for about
thirty real-time channels. But there's no contract and no set-top box
rental fee. Sling is especially handy for sports fans, as it offers a
variety of ESPN channels. For cord-cutting sports fans, this alone is
worth the price. Other popular networks, like NBC, BBC America, CNN,
Cartoon Network, TBS and the Food Network, sweeten the deal. If you sign
up for Sling Blue, which is the service's multi-stream option, and bundle
it with the more bare-bones Orange, the combo will cost you $40 per month.

<h3>Crackle: Best Streaming Service for Vegging Out</h3>

If you yearn for the halcyon days of cheesy action movies and anime
on afternoon cable, Crackle will take you back in time at no cost. The
Sony-owned platform broadcasts movies, TV shows and original programming
on a rotating basis. There's no subscription or à la carte fee,
although you do have to sit through a fair amount of commercials. While
the programming is not usually blockbuster material, it's stuff you've
heard of — think Total Recall rather than The Terminator, or Pitch
Black rather than Riddick. Some of the original shows are good, too,
like Jerry Seinfeld's Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.

<h3>HBO GO/HBO NOW: Best Service for Premium Content</h3>

HBO, the original premium content channel, now offers two ways to stream:
HBO GO (if you have HBO from a cable or satellite package) and HBO NOW
(for cord-cutters). Don't worry about any differences, as the service's
dual streaming services offer the same top-shelf content you get from
the cable channel itself. And it's library isn't just limited to only
Game of Thrones (the premiere water-cooler-talk TV show), as new seasons
of Westworld, Curb Your Enthusiasm and Veep are coming up in following
seasons. For those looking to keep track of current events, Vice News
Tonight offers beautifully produced nightly programming and Last Week
Tonight with John Oliver gives audiences sorely needed laughs. At $14.99
per month for HBO NOW, it can be a little pricey.

</h3>

The Good The TiVo Roamio is an exceptionally polished DVR for recording
free over-the-air TV. The interface is excellent and intuitive, making it
dead simple to record shows and series exactly the way you'd like. There's
built-in Wi-Fi and a 500GB hard drive. The remote is excellent and works
via RF, so you can hide the box behind a cabinet. And the hardware itself
is compact, sleek and silent.

The Bad It's very expensive when you add in subscription costs. Only the
entry-level Roamio records over-the-air TV, and it lacks the step-up
features of more expensive models. And there should be more streaming
services at this price, like HBO Go, Vudu, and a fully-functioning Amazon
Instant app.

The Bottom Line The TiVo Roamio is hands-down the best DVR for recording
over-the-air TV, but its excellence comes at a great cost.
