North (210 ac) and South Catamount (150 ac) Reservoirs at the Pikes Peak
North Slope Recreation Area

* Rainbows
* Lake trout early in year

The water levels in these reservoirs are considerably higher than
previous years at this time. Provided waters levels are adequate,
13,500 catchable fish are scheduled to be stocked throughout the summer
season in these reservoirs. Fishing should be good for trout species
especially rainbows. Fishing for lake trout should be fair early in the
spring at North Catamount and South Catamount. Although lake trout can
sometimes be difficult to locate, sampling efforts in 2013 detected lake
trout reaching over 30 inches and weighing 11 pounds. Fishing should be
good to excellent at South Catamount for rainbows.  North Catamount is
restricted to flies and lures only.  Anglers should visit the City of
Colorado Springs website for current and future hours of operation. For
more information on access, visit the Pikes Peak Highway webpage. An
acce ss fee for the Pikes Peak Highway is required to fish these lakes.

Crystal Creek Reservoir at the Pikes Peak North Slope Recreation Area (130 ac)

* rainbow and cutthroat stocked

The water level in Crystal Creek Reservoir is relatively low
however , fishing should be good to excellent for catchable sized
trout. A total of 11,000 rainbow and Snake River cutthroat trout
are scheduled to be stocked, with the majority of these fish being
stocked in the spring. Anglers can access the reservoir via the Pikes
Peak Highway. Anglers generally have good success with power bait or
worms fished 12 inches off the bottom or fly patterns fished in the late
afternoon. Anglers should visit the City of Colorado Springs website for
current and futu re hours of operation. For more information on access,
visit the Pikes Peak Highway webpage. A fee for access along the Pikes
