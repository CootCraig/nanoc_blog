Generally speaking, you don't want to apply LACQUERS over ENAMELS. I
use flat water base paints as a base coat under lacquer sanding
sealers. Sherwin Williams has great lacquer products.

Spraying Lacquer On Flat Surfaces. Over Interior Flat Paint.  The last
coat was the finish. It is a lacquer base finish that you can get on line.

The last coat is also sprayed on and it is the finish. sanding sealer
is different than Finish lacquer. The sanding sealer helps build up and
makes the job smooth. then apply your clean lacquer finish on top of your
sanding sealer last coat after you sand it.  Thanks and I hope this helps.
