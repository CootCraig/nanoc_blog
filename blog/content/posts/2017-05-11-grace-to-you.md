  John MacArthur
</h1>

John MacArthur is the pastor-teacher of Grace Community Church in Sun
Valley, California, as well as an author, conference speaker, president
of The Master’s University and Seminary, and featured teacher with
the Grace to You media ministry.

In 1969, after graduating from Talbot Theological Seminary, John came
to Grace Community Church. The emphasis of his pulpit ministry is the
careful study and verse-by-verse exposition of the Bible, with special
attention devoted to the historical and grammatical background behind each
passage. Under John’s leadership, Grace Community Church's two morning
worship services fill the 3,500-seat auditorium to capacity. Several
thousand members participate every week in dozens of fellowship groups and
training programs, most led by lay leaders and each dedicated to equipping
members for ministry on local, national, and international levels.

...

John is also president and featured teacher with Grace to You. Founded
in 1969, Grace to You is the nonprofit organization responsible for
developing, producing, and distributing John’s books, audio resources,
and the “Grace to You” radio and television programs. “Grace
to You” radio airs more than 1,000 times daily throughout the
English-speaking world, reaching major population centers with biblical
truth. It also airs nearly 1,000 times daily in Spanish, reaching 23
countries across Europe and Latin America. “Grace to You” television
airs weekly on DirecTV in the United States, and is available for free
on the Internet worldwide. All 3,000 of John’s sermons, spanning more
than four decades of ministry, are available for free on this website.
