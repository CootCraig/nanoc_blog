# Discover Catfishing

Hi, my name is Steve Douglas; I am the owner and operator of Monster
Rod Holders. I run several websites and blogs that are fishing and
outdoors related.

I am professional competitive catfish tournament angler from the state of
Kentucky, competing across the U.S. in the Cabelas King Kat Pro series
tournament trail, ranking, 2nd in the nation among my peers for two
consecutive years in a row.
