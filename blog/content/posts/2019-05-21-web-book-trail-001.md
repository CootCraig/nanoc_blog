I could have sworn Kidnapped was a book club choice, but I guess I
read it when it came up for discussion in some thread. As it happens,
I loved Kidnapped but ended up abandoning David Balfour. Overall, I'm
a huge fan of Stevenson's nonfiction, his travel works and essays.

  UTILITARIANISM BY JOHN STUART MILL - chapter 5
</h3>

In one point of view, they may be considered as corollaries from the
principles already laid down. If it is a duty to do to each according
to his deserts, returning good for good as well as repressing evil
by evil, it necessarily follows that we should treat all equally well
(when no higher duty forbids) who have deserved equally well of us, and
that <b>society should treat all equally well who have deserved equally
well of it, that is, who have deserved equally well absolutely. This
is the highest abstract standard of social and distributive justice;
towards which all institutions, and the efforts of all virtuous citizens,
should be made in the utmost possible degree to converge.</b>

A good accompaniment to this book is
Gillespie's Theological Origins of Modernity,
in which he shows the paths Western thought took at the point of the
Reformation and its immediate precursors, once it denied the reality
of forms (like an independently existing human nature, existing
independently of any human person, which God could take on and repair
in one incarnation, which Adam could screw up in one fall).

  Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition by Michael Pomazansky
</h3>

Protopresbyter Michael Pomazansky's Orthodox Dogmatic Theology has
long been regarded as a standard source of Orthodox theology. Since its
publication in Russian in 1963, it has been used as the main theology
textbook at Holy Trinity Orthodox Seminary in Jordanville, New York;
and since the publication of the first English edition in 1983, it has
come to be regarded throughout the English-speaking world as one of the
best introductory books on Orthodox theology. Written clearly, simply
and concisely, this modern-day classic is accessible not only to theology
students but to the contemporary layman in general. As one deeply rooted
in the tradition of the Orthodox Church, Fr. Michael quotes abundantly
from the Holy Scriptures and the writings of the Holy Fathers, being
concerned to present, not human opinions, but Divine Revelation, which
has been handed down to us as the Church s certain, unchanging teaching.
