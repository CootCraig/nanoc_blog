To give you a ballpark figure, freelance grant-proposal writers
generally charge between $60 and $150 per hour, says Gail Vertz,
executive director of the American Association of Grant Professionals,
in Kansas City, Kan. However, within that range, she says, fees vary
tremendously depending upon a consultant's location, the needs in his
or her community, and what other local consultants are charging.
Above all else, remember â€” you are not a nonprofit group.

"You can, and should, still care about the missions of the organizations
that you help raise money for, but you also have to have the confidence
to ask to be paid a reasonable wage," says Ms. Trimarco. "No one should
be getting rich from nonprofit grant-writing, but if you want to make
a living at this, you can't afford to just break even."
