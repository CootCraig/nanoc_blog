The Briggs & Stratton Raptor series is a line of single-cylinder,
four-cycle flathead engines that has been in use since the early 1970s.

### Raptor III

Released in 1995, the third and final Raptor, the Raptor III,
had five horsepower. The only thing different from the II was that
this one had a cast-alloy crank with a carbon-infused piston. This
engine sold phenomenally, however, and almost phased out its two
predecessors. Hundreds of thousands of these engines remain in service
today, and are the best-selling racing engine of all time.
