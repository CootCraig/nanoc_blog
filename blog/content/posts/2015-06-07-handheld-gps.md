The most popular GPS unit for use with OSM, by a long chalk, is the
Garmin eTrex Legend HCx. It's rugged, has plenty of memory (if you put a
MicroSD card in it), lasts a day on standard rechargeable AA batteries,
and is fairly easy to use. You can put your own maps on it, and indeed
many OSMers either use the mkgmap program to create their own Garmin
map 'images' from OSM data, or download one of the many pre-built
images. These include customised walking, cycling and boating styles
and even 'no-name' styles which highlight unnamed roads in OSM.

Uploading traces to your computer, if you have a MicroSD card installed,
is a simple matter of connecting the two via a normal USB cable, putting
the Garmin into "mass storage mode", and copying the file across. (If
you also want to copy waypoints, you'll need to use GPSBabel or a
similar program.)

After years with a little map-free yellow eTrex and a Geko 201, I got a
Legend HCx for Christmas a few years back and have been delighted with
it. Having the OSM map on your GPS really does make a difference.

Don't take too much notice of the list price on the Garmin site - in the
UK these units are widely discounted, and I presume the same is true in
the States.

I've been recommending the Legend HCx for a long time, but I recently
upgraded that to the Vista HCx since there's now only about Â£5
difference. See http://www.gravitystorm.co.uk/shine/gps-recommendations/
