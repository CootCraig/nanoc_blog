  The Best Reel Mower for Your (Small) Lawn
</h2>

The Scotts makes the cleanest cut, has the widest cutting path, and jams
the least of any reel mower, and its unusually tall 3-inch max cutting
height makes it more versatile for different grass types.

We eliminated about 90 percent of the mowers based on insufficient maximum
cut height alone. Models by Mascot and Gardena, as well as the Remington
RM3000, the 16-inch Weed Eater, the 18-inch and 20-inch Greenworks
models, and the 18-inch ProMow all failed to meet our minimum 2½-inch
max cut height. We didn’t bother to test any of these mowers, since
they couldn’t cut high enough to avoid potentially damaging your lawn.

The Scotts 2000-20 20-Inch Classic Push Reel Lawn Mower is the reel mower
to get. Of the tested mowers, it offered the cleanest cut and the easiest
adjustments, and it was the only one that didn’t jam. It also has a
wide, 20-inch cutting swath—the widest we found—as well as height
adjustments between 1 and 3 inches, which is a more versatile range than
we saw on almost all of the other available reel mowers. At 34 pounds,
it’s light and easy to turn around at the end of each mowing row,
but it’s heavy enough that it doesn’t bounce around on slightly
uneven turf.

In addition, all of the adjustments on the Scotts mower are easy to
make. For cutting height, it has two levers, one for each wheel. One
other model we tested, the 16-inch Great States 415-16, required us to
unbolt it each time we wanted to change the cutting height. Also, the
height settings on the Scotts model are accurate; the 1-inch setting on
the Fiskars, in contrast, actually cut much lower, practically scalping
the lawn, before we readjusted it to a higher setting.

<h3>Care and maintenance</h3>

One of the advantages of a reel mower is that it doesn’t require much
maintenance. After each mow, just hose off any stray grass and grime,
and let it dry in the sun.

It isn’t a bad idea to wipe down the blades with a rag moistened with
household oil once a season to prevent rust.

You also have to pay attention to the blade adjustment, because it can
shift over time. With most reel mowers, the spinning blades pass over a
stationary bed knife, which is where the cutting happens. If the blades
are too far from the bed knife, they won’t cut grass. If they move too
close, they’ll hit the bed knife harder, making the mower difficult to
push and rapidly dulling the blades. The adjustment, usually involving
a couple of set screws, is easy.

Even with proper adjustment, the blades will need sharpening after a
few seasons (American Lawn Mower sells a sharpening kit).

  OT - sharpening push reel mower with lapping compound - what grit?
</h4>

I used automotive valve grinding compound the last time I did it. medium
grit worked ok, but if you want to do it twice & then use a finer grit,
that would work too.

Not sure what videos you watched. 240 grit (medium) works fine. Don't
forget you're rotating the reel backwards so you don't round off the
cutting edges. You can look at the reel and the bedknife wear pattern
now and see what condition they're in. If the reel blades are worn
completely cylindrical you're not going to get much from lapping. You
want a small land and a relief just like a primary and secondary on a
milling cutter on the reel blade and just a small land on the bedknife
for the best cutting action without undue effort.
