knotscott - 
I’ve rehabbed a few old Emerson made Cman saws. For average surface
rust/patina of an older saw I just go at it with mineral spirits or WD40
and 180 grit sandpaper on my ROS, followed by finer grit, Boeshield T-9,
then paste wax. For heavier rust I use start with some form of priopionic
acid (Boeshield, Krud Kutter, etc.). Scotchbrite pad works well for a
newer saws with minor spots.

## Previous notes

My survey says use this post by Marc J. Spagnuolo as a guide.
From Rush's get 220 and 2 grits of wet/dry abrasive papaer
and a tube of graphite.
From Harbor Freight get a Random Orbital palm sander.
From Home Depot get an aluminum sanding block and
PB blaster and/or wd40.

* steel wool
* ROS sander
* sanding block

The first step in fixing it is abrasion. I like to use naptha, mineral
spirits, or WD-40 as a lubricant and either steel wool or 1000/2000
grit sandpaper as the abrasive. A couple minutes of light sanding and
the rust comes right up. I then wipe away the rust/metal sludge and
apply a light coat of Renaissance Wax. I still don’t have all of my
stuff over to the new shop yet so I didn’t do my usual protective mix,
which is T9 Boeshield followed by the wax.



* Steel wool
* wet/dry abrasive paper
* scotch brite pad
* sanding block
* Boeshield Rust Free
* Boeshield T-9
* Paste wax (mothers carauba or johnsons)
* Random Orbital sander
* Bostik GlideCote (not now, more expensive than paste wax)

Clean and condition saw top and both wings.
