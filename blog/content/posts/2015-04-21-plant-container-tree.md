When to stake.
Shows pipe stake tied with inner tube.

Our cottonwood is tall with small root ball.
So stake.

Catherine Stewart:
In Australia we now recommend using 2 stakes, one either side of the
root ball, with a figure 8 loop of stocking/jute webbing between them,
rather than only one stake. It allows for some controlled trunk movement
without holding it too tightly and also prevents people putting a large
stake close to the trunk and right through the rootball.
