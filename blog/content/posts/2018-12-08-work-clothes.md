<h4>Eagles Nest amazon review</h4>

Just say no to the defective "Made in Honduras" model. Insist on the "Made in Mexico / Nicaragua", and accept nothing less.

Color: BlackSize: 32W x 34LVerified Purchase

If you get the "Made in Honduras", just send them back. They are nothing
but defective. You want the "Made in Mexico / Nicaragua." Settle for
nothing less. I have been wearing these for years and when I put these
on, I immediately noticed a coarse rough fabric that I have never
experienced with my "Made in Mexico / Nicaragua" models which I have
4 pairs of. They fold oddly and they hang on the hanger oddly, because
the fabric was processed differently, is of a different quality, and is
cut to different specifications. I typically see no difference between
the Made in Mexico or Made in Nicaragua. For some reason their Honduran
production is way off. I almost thought I received counterfeits due to
the differences being so dramatic. I then read the comments and noticed
several others have had the same gosh darn problem.

I ordered 2 pairs of this exact same model from this exact same link
in the exact same 32/34 size, but this time I got the terrible "Made
in Honduras" which had rough fabric and a weird fit. On top of that,
one pair was sewn incorrectly on the right pant leg so badly that I
can't believe it made it past quality control. It's a strong indication
that whomever is running the Honduras production for Williamson-Dickie
is doing a very poor job of ensuring quality control. In any event,
I have returned both pair as defective and will continue to do so until
I receive "Made in Mexico."

What a run around....and my wife wonders why I like to order 8 pairs of
the same pair of pants when I find something that actually works. Who
wants to do this return and wait nonsense all the time just because a
clothing manufacturer can't produce a consistent product regardless of
the point of manufacture.? Not this freaking guy...

Also, the "Made in Honduras" were a full 5 ounces lighter than the "Made
in Mexico", so there's your proof right there that they are skimping
on cotton in the Honduras factory and most likely skimping on every
other aspect of their production within that facility. What a waste of
a factory....
