Looking back over the last nine years I've been able to put some things
together that likely contributed to improved coronary arteries. It is
a journey into research, education and a determined effort to find and
develop an enhanced protocol that slows, stops, and really regresses
this disease.

<h1>Cureality Lipid targets</h1>

<pre>
Although targets for small LDL particles are poorly sorted out, practical
and achievable endpoints are:
    By NMR: 200 nmol/L or less small LDL particles

The next most important number on the lipoprotein report after small
LDL is LDL particle number (NMR)

we aim to keep LDL particle number 700 nmol/L or less
</pre>

<h2>NMR - 2017-05-10</h2>

<pre>
ldl-p 1774 nmol/L (target 700 nmol/L)
ldl-c 143 mg/dL
hdl-c 47 mg/dL
Triglycerides 68 mg/dL
hdl-p (total) 26.7 umol/L
small ldl-p 630 nmol/L (target 200 nmol/L)
ldl size 20.9 nm
