  Irrigation Pump Tutorial - Selecting a Pump Type
</h2>

If you're thinking of installing a new pump, or just want to understand
your existing pumping system better, this tutorial should provide you
with the information you need to get started. I strongly recommend you
read the whole thing. Most of the questions I get asked are answered here,
all you need to do is read the whole thing. Yep, I know it's a long read!

  Well Irrigation Systems
</h2>

There is one feature seldom found on irrigation controllers that is
usually necessary to have on any system that is fed by a well. It's called
"delay between stations" and it allows you to set a variable length delay
between stations to allow a well to recharge as explained below (or to
allow a slow valve to close in low pressure situations). We offer two
controllers with this feature; the Hunter ICC controller (delay between
stations from 1 sec to 1 minute 40 sec) and the Rain Bird ESPLX series
(delay between stations from 1 sec to 9 hours). The ICC controller has a
"cycle and soak" feature that can be used in some circumstances to achieve
longer delays between watering periods, but if your well needs long
recharge times, the ESPLX series may be a better choice for you. Most
wells that were not primarily designed for irrigation will provide
relatively modest steady state flow rates, requiring relatively small
stations, and a lot of them. It's no coincidence that the two controllers
we offer with the "delay between stations" feature are also available
with a large number of stations. The ESPLX+ controller is available up
to 24 stations. The ICC controller is available with up to 48 stations,
although the delay between stations option limits the program to much
shorter values than the ESPLX series.

We offer two controllers with this feature; the Hunter ICC controller
(delay between stations from 1 sec to 1 minute 40 sec) and the Rain
Bird ESPLX series (delay between stations from 1 sec to 9 hours). The
ICC controller has a "cycle and soak" feature that can be used in some
circumstances to achieve longer delays between watering periods, but if
your well needs long recharge times, the ESPLX series may be a better
choice for you.

ICC Controller Has Been Replaced By The I-Core Controller.  The ICC is
Hunter's original commercial grade controller. It was sunset in 2011 to
make way for the I-Core, which offers  innovative features like state of
the art flow monitoring, quick system overview access, a factory-installed
SmartPort®, six language capability, and a bold, graphic display. It
is also compatible with the Solar Sync weather sensor and Dual two-wire
decoder system. The I-Core is recommended as the replacement for the ICC.

  How to design a sprinkler system which uses a pump
</h2>

<h3>Pump Relays</h3>

Any irrigation system fed by a pump will require a relay such as the
Hunter PSR Pump Start Relay listed in the controller section of our
catalog to provide power for the pump. The controller simply can't provide
nearly enough power for the pump, so a large power line is run directly
to the pump from the breaker box, and a pump start relay located at the
pump is activated by the controller when it's time to water. The pump
start relay requires about the same amount of power to activate as a
standard station valve, so the controller must be designed to support
the additional power required. Most of the cheap controllers at the
retail stores don't have this feature, and even when they do, their
transformers are often severely taxed by the additional load. Nearly all
of the controllers we offer in our catalog can comfortably run a pump
relay in addition to a station valve, and many can run two valves and a
pump simultaneously. If your controller advertises a "master valve" or
"pump start" feature, this indicates it can support the power required
to activate the pump start relay. Some people who do not have a pump
choose to use this feature to power a Master valve.

</pre>

<h4>Master valve</h4>

A electric valve which opens whenever any station is watering, and closes
when no station valves are on, shutting off the pressure in the main
line. A master valve will greatly reduce any water loss due to a leaky
station valve because the leaky station valve can only leak while the
master valve is providing pressure to the system. Also, if you damage the
irrigation main line, a master valve will control water loss so the main
can be repaired without shutting off the water supply. A master electric
valve is typically the same type of valve as you would use for your
station valves, but rather than being installed downstream from your main
line and connected to a station output in your controller it is installed
upstream at the front of the main line and connected to the "master" or
"pump" connection in your controller. Not all controllers support a mater
valve or pump- be sure to check the features before buying a controller.

Important: Any well with a high static water level may allow the pump to
operate off the curve and outside its recommended range. We recommend
using a "Dole" flow restriction valve to throttle the pump to prevent
upthrust damage to the pump and motor. The maximum flow must be restricted
to within the pumps recommended operating range.

<h2>Dole Flow Regulators</h2>

The Dole Flow Regulator is self-cleaning and designed to deliver
a constant volume of water flow over a wide pressure drop range. The
controlling mechanism is a flexible orifice that varies its effective
area inversely with applied pressure so that a constant flow rate is
maintained.

Flow rates will be maintained to within ±15% between 15 and 125 psi. The
flow rate varies due to manufacturing tolerances and water temperatures.
Valves are chrome or nickle-plated brass with Buna-N orifice.

Cycle Stop Valves, Inc. manufactures constant pressure pump control
valves and the Cycle Sensor pump monitors. Their shop is located in
Lubbock, TX. We started this venture in the back of our pump and drilling
business in 1993. As with many new products, necessity is the mother
of invention. Our frustration with variable speed drives is what led us
to a simpler, more dependable, less expensive solution using valves. We
installed our last VFD in 1992.

  Water Well Drilling Instructional Course - Plans And DVD - $29.95
</h3>

If you want to drill a well in your backyard cheaper and easier than you
ever thought possible, this DVD and instruction booklet will make your
dream a reality! The DVD takes you step-by-step through the drilling
process from assembling the drilling rig all the way through to casing
your well! Drilling a well CAN be an easy, inexpensive process - even
to someone without a great deal of technical know-how!

Meanwhile the plans contain step-by-step instructions for assembling
the kit, drilling the well, important information about the geology of
well drilling, a section of Frequently Asked Questions, and a complete
set of instructions for making your own tools and bits.

This is not just a user manual. This teaches you how to drill wells -
a daunting subject made simple. It's also not an infomercial for the
drill. You don't have to ever buy another thing from us if you don't
want to - the DVDs show you how to do everything for yourself, including
making the drill from scratch from locally available materials.Of course,
you'll save time and probably have a slightly more powerful product
if you buy our kit, but many people have drilled their own well using
nothing more than this DVD and the tools they made at home.

While drilling a well with our Ready-To-Drill kit requires little
mechanical knowledge, no experience, and only a moderate amount of
physical strength, redesigning a tool from scratch to assemble your own
kit does require a few mechanical abilities and even then it may be a
bit intimidating at first.

  Air Powered Water Pump - $49.95
</h3>

This is the air powered pump described in Chapter 14 of the plans; if
you'd prefer not to take the trouble to build it yourself, we offer it
here. It is powered by air, of which only a relatively low volume is
required (as low as 40 PSI may be adequate) to pump your well. It can
even pump water that is very dirty. This is the ideal tool to pump the
silt out of your well after you case it, before installing a regular
jet or submersible pump.

The only drawback to this pump is that you are not able to use it to
pressurize a house or other water system; due to the way the air lift pump
works, by floating the water out on bubbles of air, the flow that comes
out the end of the pump is about 70% air mixed with about 30% water (exact
proportions vary widely with depth, head, pressure and volume). This is
only suitable for pumping silt out of your well, or pumping your cleaned
well into an open sprinkler, pond, or an unpressurized tank.

  Can I use this to clean out my existing well?

Actually, I wouldn't bother with the drill at all. You might be able to
save a bunch of money by just using the air-powered water pump available
in our catalog - it only costs 49.95, takes a smaller compressor, and is
designed to suck out sand from wells like that and clean them out. If
it works at all, it will be much cheaper and probably will do as good
a job for this specific application as the drill.

<h4>Standard Sizes</h4>

Polyethylene pipe can be made in diameters ranging from 1/2 inch to 63
inches in diameter. It is most commonly found in 3/4-inch, 1-inch and 1
1/4-inch sizes. Because polyethylene pipe is manufactured in a continuous
extrusion process, it is also available in almost any length. Polyethylene
pipe can be purchased in rolls hundreds of feet long.

<h4>Water Pipe Standards</h4>

The American Water Works Association has issued standards for polyethylene
pipes used to carry water and waste-water in homes and businesses. AWWA
standard C-901-08 applies when the pipe has a diameter of ½ inches to
3 inches. AWWA standard C-906-07 applies to large-diameter polyethylene
pipe with diameters from 4 inches to 63 inches. These standards define how
polyethylene water and waste-water pipes must be labeled, the pressure
ratings they must endure, and test methods to ensure that they do not
corrode in the presence of water or leech chemicals into the water. Both
of these AWWA standards have also been adopted by the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI).


<h5>Poly tube</h5> is commonly used in areas with cold winters (where the
soil freezes,) and is also used in special situations that require a more
flexible tube be used, such as very rocky soil.  High density polyethylene
(HDPE) with high pressure ratings is much more widely stocked in home
and irrigation stores than previously.  New “push fittings” for poly
tube that are universal and don’t require clamps make installation much
easier and faster.  Both of these developments have resulted in increased
use of poly tube in all areas, regardless of climate.  Poly tube doesn’t
break as easily if water freezes in it.  Poly tube is more forgiving in
rocky soils (big rocks, like granite boulders) as it is less likely to
crack if it is installed against the side of a large rock.

Poly tube is rated by a system of “SDR” ratios, sometimes labeled
just “DR”.  The lower the SDR number, the stronger the tube is.
HDPE poly is commonly rated for 80, 100, 160, 200, and 250 PSI working
pressure or operating pressure (NOT burst pressure!)   The cheapest
form of poly is sold as “irrigation pipe” and is rated for 80 PSI
(sometimes 100 PSI), it is commonly used for low-pressure laterals on
irrigation systems.   Remember the lateral is only the pipe after the
valves, between the valve and the actual sprinkler head.  All poly tube
of the same size will have the same INSIDE diameter.

<h4>What is a well yield test?</h4>

Determining the yield of a well involves a test to see the balance between
the maximum amount of water that can be pumped out of the well and the
amount of water that recharges back into the well from the surrounding
ground water source.

The test requires the continuous pumping of the well for an extended
period of time. During the pumping period, measurements are made of 1)
the rate at which water is being pumped out of the well and 2) the
distance the water level is lowered in the well as a result of the
pumping, known as the draw down.

Balance, or equilibrium, is achieved when the water level within the well
stops dropping for a given discharge rate. Once equilibrium is achieved,
less pumping results in less drawdown.  Water well professionals rely
on the yield pump test to set the well pump at the correct level.

It is common to maintain the water level in the well at least 25 feet
above the top of the submersible pump. This depth of water over the pump
provides a reasonable level of safety for dry conditions and provides
for full cooling of the pump’s electrical motor.

For an existing well already in use, a water well professional can
create an artificial water demand on the home’s plumbing system so
that the well pump runs continuously and water discharges from exterior
faucets. Measurements can be taken during this con stant pumping.

In either case, the yield test will generate lots of water that must be
discharged to an appropriate location. Take care not to let the water
flow towards or back into the well being pumped. Try to direct the water
to a stream, pond or wetlands.

For new wells, piping can be used to direct water away from the well
being tested. For testing of existing wells, lengths of garden hose can
be connected to outside faucets to direct the water to an appropriate
location
