  Irrigation Pump Tutorial - Selecting a Pump Type
</h2>

If you're thinking of installing a new pump, or just want to understand
your existing pumping system better, this tutorial should provide you
with the information you need to get started. I strongly recommend you
read the whole thing. Most of the questions I get asked are answered here,
all you need to do is read the whole thing. Yep, I know it's a long read!

  Well Irrigation Systems
</h2>

There is one feature seldom found on irrigation controllers that is
usually necessary to have on any system that is fed by a well. It's called
"delay between stations" and it allows you to set a variable length delay
between stations to allow a well to recharge as explained below (or to
allow a slow valve to close in low pressure situations). We offer two
controllers with this feature; the Hunter ICC controller (delay between
stations from 1 sec to 1 minute 40 sec) and the Rain Bird ESPLX series
(delay between stations from 1 sec to 9 hours). The ICC controller has a
"cycle and soak" feature that can be used in some circumstances to achieve
longer delays between watering periods, but if your well needs long
recharge times, the ESPLX series may be a better choice for you. Most
wells that were not primarily designed for irrigation will provide
relatively modest steady state flow rates, requiring relatively small
stations, and a lot of them. It's no coincidence that the two controllers
we offer with the "delay between stations" feature are also available
with a large number of stations. The ESPLX+ controller is available up
to 24 stations. The ICC controller is available with up to 48 stations,
although the delay between stations option limits the program to much
shorter values than the ESPLX series.

We offer two controllers with this feature; the Hunter ICC controller
(delay between stations from 1 sec to 1 minute 40 sec) and the Rain
Bird ESPLX series (delay between stations from 1 sec to 9 hours). The
ICC controller has a "cycle and soak" feature that can be used in some
circumstances to achieve longer delays between watering periods, but if
your well needs long recharge times, the ESPLX series may be a better
choice for you.

  Hunter I-Core series controllers
</h2>

ICC Controller Has Been Replaced By The I-Core Controller.  The ICC is
Hunter's original commercial grade controller. It was sunset in 2011 to
make way for the I-Core, which offers  innovative features like state of
the art flow monitoring, quick system overview access, a factory-installed
SmartPort®, six language capability, and a bold, graphic display. It
is also compatible with the Solar Sync weather sensor and Dual two-wire
decoder system. The I-Core is recommended as the replacement for the ICC.

  How to design a sprinkler system which uses a pump
</h2>

<h3>Pump Relays</h3>

Any irrigation system fed by a pump will require a relay such as the
Hunter PSR Pump Start Relay listed in the controller section of our
catalog to provide power for the pump. The controller simply can't provide
nearly enough power for the pump, so a large power line is run directly
to the pump from the breaker box, and a pump start relay located at the
pump is activated by the controller when it's time to water. The pump
start relay requires about the same amount of power to activate as a
standard station valve, so the controller must be designed to support
the additional power required. Most of the cheap controllers at the
retail stores don't have this feature, and even when they do, their
transformers are often severely taxed by the additional load. Nearly all
of the controllers we offer in our catalog can comfortably run a pump
relay in addition to a station valve, and many can run two valves and a
pump simultaneously. If your controller advertises a "master valve" or
"pump start" feature, this indicates it can support the power required
to activate the pump start relay. Some people who do not have a pump
choose to use this feature to power a Master valve.

<h4>Master valve</h4>

A electric valve which opens whenever any station is watering, and closes
when no station valves are on, shutting off the pressure in the main
line. A master valve will greatly reduce any water loss due to a leaky
station valve because the leaky station valve can only leak while the
master valve is providing pressure to the system. Also, if you damage the
irrigation main line, a master valve will control water loss so the main
can be repaired without shutting off the water supply. A master electric
valve is typically the same type of valve as you would use for your
station valves, but rather than being installed downstream from your main
line and connected to a station output in your controller it is installed
upstream at the front of the main line and connected to the "master" or
"pump" connection in your controller. Not all controllers support a mater
valve or pump- be sure to check the features before buying a controller.
