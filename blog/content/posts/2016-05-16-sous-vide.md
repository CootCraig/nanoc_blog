<h3>Sous Vide Cooking Times</h3>

The temperature and time that you cook your food at depends on the food,
the texture that you desire, and if you’ll be serving anyone who’s
immune compromised.

The time it takes for the center of the food to reach desired cooking
temperature depends on the initial temperature, thickness and shape of
the food item and the temperature of the bath. But when cooking sous vide,
it is sometimes necessary to hold the food at desired target temperature
for some additional time for a few reasons.

<h3>Minimum time</h3>

Tenderize tough meats, for example beef brisket and short ribs, benefit
from longer cooking times. As Douglas Baldwin taught us, tough cuts
can be made tender and still be a medium-rare to medium doneness by
converting collagen (the connective tissue that holds muscle fibers,
bones, and fat in place) into tender gelatin by holding the meat at
between 130°F/55°C and 140°F/60°C for six hours to three days. At
below 140°F/60°C, enzymes (such as collagenases) can significantly
increase tenderness after about six hours. Above about 130°F/55°C, heat
will begin breaking down collagen into gelatin and reduce inter-fiber
adhesion; the amount of time needed to tenderize decreases exponentially
as the temperature increases, so it’ll take about 2 days to make a chuck
roast fork-tender at 130°F/55°C and less than an hour in a pressure
cooker. For more information, see §2 of his guide or his review article.

Pasteurize the food by holding it in the water bath until any
foodborne pathogens have been reduced to a safe-level. This only
works if target cooking temperature is above 126.1°F/52.3°C. Below
this temperature, food needs to be served immediately and it won't be
pasteurized. Pasteurizing is required for the Cook - Chill - Freeze -
Reheat sous vide method that we explain in Finishing Food After Cooking
Sous Vide lesson. More on this at the end of this article.

<h3>Maximum Time</h3>

There is also a maximum time that you can hold the food in the sous vide
water bath and it varies by food type. In some foods, such as chicken,
fish and some tender cuts, enzymes may cause a mush-like texture  if hold
in the bath for too long as they break down too much of the connective
tissue and inter-fiber adhesion. Chicken becomes mushy after about 4
hours while for fish it may be just a few minutes.

For this reason, fish and tender cuts usually just need to be brought
up to temperature and then served. As Douglas Baldwin explains, this
frequently means that fish and tender cuts cannot be pasteurized —
that is, reduce any foodborne pathogens to a safe-level — and made
safe for immuno-compromised people. Some tender cuts, such as poultry,
should always be pasteurized since they’re likely to make even healthy
people sick.

Beef and tougher cuts can be hold in the sous vide bath for long times
and they usually benefit from this as explained before. Over time the
connective tissue in the muscle will eventually weaken, but such a change
might take days at such low temperatures.

#### reviews

Amazon review By Chris B on November 20, 2013 -
Box and Sliding Lid Work Great for Sous Vide.

Size: 4.75-Gallon

I just got this food box to use with my Anova sous vide water
circulator. It is the perfect size for that machine and is about as large
a box as you can use for what that machine is rated for (5-6 gallons). I
can also tell you that the gallons listed in the description is not
accurate. It is not 1.75 gallons. It is 4.75 gallons. I purchased the
sliding lid (Cambro 1218SCCW135) separately and that works perfectly. I
can slide the lid mostly shut (except for the width of the machine). I
covered the remaining small opening with a piece of foil. There are no
modifications required to the lid to fit the machine which is great
considering most of the reviews I read talked about cutting holes in
the lids. That is not something I want to do and Polycarbonate is easy
to crack/shatter.

### Review

5.0 out of 5 stars The Searzall is a wonderful tool to add to your quiver of "modernist" equipment

The Searzall is a wonderful tool to add to your quiver of "modernist"
equipment. Its specialty is precise control over browning, and my five
star review is absolutely based on the fact that I understood this before
I bought it. If you're looking for a tool for quick searing of sous vide
steaks for your dinner party with your ten closest friends, buy a "MAPP"
canister and run open flame to save yourself the arm cramping. This tool
does NOT sear quickly. However, when it comes to things like seafood
(shellfish especially) that require a light touch, or beautifully and
perfectly searing any item, this tool is invaluable. Like any specialty
equipment... understand its limitations, understand the true benefits
over working without it, and it will impress you with its ease of use
to create exactly the level of searing you were aiming for.

Awesome tool.

I don't know how I lived without a blowtorch and the Searzall... This
does a GREAT job. It takes a while to get comfortable using it (tip:
get closer than you think... you've gotta really sear that steak!)

I now use this for EVERYTHING. Helping cheese melt on an omlette, grilled
cheese, Top of a chili dog, browning almost anything... It's awesome. The
mesh does disfigure a bit, bulging out in the center, and I can tell it'll
probably need periodic replacement... hopefully not too difficult to do,
but I haven't tried that yet.
