<h2>
  About Peter at
  <a href="https://peterrollins.com/" target="_blank">//peterrollins.com/</a>
</h2>

Peter Rollins is a writer, philosopher, storyteller and public speaker
who has gained an international reputation for overturning traditional
notions of religion and forming “churches” that preach the Good
News that we can’t be satisfied, that life is difficult, and that we
don’t know the secret.

Challenging the idea that faith concerns questions relating to belief,
Peter’s incendiary and irreligious reading of Christianity attacks
the distinction between the sacred and the secular. It blurs the lines
between theism and atheism and it sets aside questions regarding life
after death to explore the possibility of life before death.

Peter gained his higher education from Queens University, Belfast where
he earned degrees (with distinction) in Scholastic Philosophy (BA Hons),
Political Theory and Social Criticism (MA) and Post-Structural thought
(PhD). He's the author of numerous books, including Insurrection,
The Idolatry of God, and The Divine Magician. He was born in Belfast,
Northern Ireland, currently lives in Los Angeles and will die somewhere
as yet not known.
