AmblesideOnline is a free homeschool curriculum that uses Charlotte
Mason's classically-based principles to prepare children for a life
of rich relationships with everything around them: God, humanity,
and the natural world. AO's detailed schedules, time-tested methods,
and extensive teacher resources allow parents to focus effectively on
the unique needs of each child.

The AmblesideOnline library hosts a large collection of original Charlotte
Mason materials, which have been digitized by our volunteers. In addition,
our community offers a wide variety of resources for homeschooling
parents and Charlotte Mason educators: a support forum, an archive of
wisdom from experienced Charlotte Mason educators, as well as original
and current books and articles about Charlotte Mason's living ideas.

mother named Tammy. In 2008, the site was acquired by Home School,
Inc. (www.Home-School-Inc.com), a company committed to providing families
with valuable tools and access to information so that they may experience
the wonderful joys of homeschooling.
