### [Wikipedia - Frame and Panel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_and_panel)

Frame and panel construction, also called rail and stile, is a woodworking
technique often used in the making of doors, wainscoting, and other
decorative features for cabinets, furniture, and homes. The basic idea
is to capture a 'floating' panel within a sturdy frame, as opposed to
techniques used in making a slab solid wood cabinet door or drawer front,
the door is constructed of several solid wood pieces running in a vertical
or horizontal direction [1] with exposed endgrains. Usually, the panel is
not glued to the frame but is left to 'float' within it so that seasonal
movement of the wood comprising the panel does not distort the frame.

Frame and panel construction at its most basic consists of five members:
the panel and the four members which make up the frame. The vertical
members of the frame are called stiles while the horizontal members are
known as rails. A basic frame and panel item consists of a top rail,
a bottom rail, two stiles, and a panel. This is a common method of
constructing cabinet doors and these are often referred to as a five
piece door.

In larger panels it is common to divide the panel into one or more
sections. To house the extra panels, dividing pieces known as mid rails
and mid stiles or muntins are added to the frame.
