  Kobo Aura One - A Near Perfect eReader - October 18, 2017 By Albert Silver
</h3>

The first, sorry to say, is that question of the ecosystem. I am perfectly
willing to buy an ebook from the Kobo store so long as I am not paying
extra for the privilege. There is talk about pricematching, but Kobo
themselves state that it is not universal and subject to approval (Amazon
is no different), so when in doubt, I just buy it from Amazon. This
brings up the issue of accessing my not insignificant number of ebooks
purchased through Amazon, and that one might worry are locked into
their ecosystem. Luckily this is not true. Downloading and converting
my Kindle ebooks to read on the Kobo is very easy once you know how, and
requires using Cailbre, an ereader software swiss-army knife, and a few
plugins that remove the DRM and do the conversion. The entire process
can take a couple of minutes, from download to copying to the device,
but is fairly painless.

It needs to be pointed out also, that if you plan to sideload ebooks
(meaning add ebooks via cable from your computer) knowing how to convert
to the Kepub format is useful as it is the only format that supports
the page counts in chapters.

  Rakuten Kobo Aura One Limited Edition Review: Keeping up with the Kindles isn't easy
  What was once a potential Kindle-killer is now playing catch-up.
  By Séamus Bellamy PCWorld | Jan 2, 2018
</h3>

When the Kobo Aura One was released in 2016, with its large, bright
display and exclusives like Pocket and OverDrive integration, it had
the potential to be a Kindle-killer. It was a flagship device that
cost less and arguably did more than Amazon’s Kindle Oasis. In 2017,
however, the Kindle Oasis has caught up, and the Limited Edition has
little new to offer. Unless you’re tied into Kobo’s ebook ecosystem,
or resisting the inexorable pull of Amazon, the excellent 2017 Kindle
Oasis is likely your better bet for a premium reading experience.

  NOOK File Formats: EPUB and PDF
  By Corey Sandler 
</h4>

The NOOK Color and the NOOK Simple Touch work with files created using
one of two eBook formats: EPUB or PDF.

The EPUB format is free and open, meaning that anyone can produce and
distribute a file using this standard.

An EPUB file is reflowable, meaning that the text can be fine-tuned to the
demands of nearly any electronic reader or to the personal preferences
of any human reader: typefaces can be changed, their size adjusted,
and other attributes modified.

Unprotected EPUBs are commonly used for distribution of books that are
no longer under copyright.

Protected EPUBs include Digital Rights Management, encoding intended to
limit the use of the file to a single purchaser, an individual machine,
or to set a time limit.
