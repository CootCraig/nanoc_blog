#### A potted history of Cherry

#### Linear switches

##### Cherry MX Red

Conversely, Cherry MX Red switches were only introduced in 2008 and
are the most recent switch to be developed by the company. They have a
low actuation force, at 45 cN – tied with Brown for the lowest of the
four most common switches. Red switches have been marketed as a gaming
switch, with the light weighting allowing for more rapid actuation,
and have become increasingly common in gaming keyboards.

#### Tactile, non-clicky switches

##### Cherry MX Brown

The most popular type of tactile, non-clicky switch is the Cherry MX
Brown. This switch was introduced in 1994 as a special ‘ergo soft’
switch, but quickly became one of the most popular switches. Today,
the majority of Filco keyboards are sold with Brown switches, as the
switch is a good middle-of-the-road option appropriate for both typing
and gaming. They are also ideal for typing in office environments,
where a clicky switch might annoy some.

#### Tactile, clicky switches

##### Cherry MX Blue

The Cherry MX Blue is the most common clicky switch, and was first made
available in Filco keyboards in 2007. Blue switches are favoured by
typists due to their tactile bump and audible click, but can be less
suitable for gaming as the weighting is relatively high – 50 cN –
and it is a bit harder to double tap, as the release point is above
the actuation point. Blue switches are noticeably louder than other
mechanical switches, which are already louder than rubber domes, so
these switches can be a bit disruptive in close working conditions.

Fact: Nearly all keyboards sold bundled with computers or at retail stores
use rubber domes under their keys. This is the same technology used in
cheap TV remotes. They're made to be as cheap as possible to manufacture
in order to maximize profits. Yes, this even includes "high end"
keyboards. So why settle for something that is made as cheap as possible?

There is no switch perfect for a given task for everyone, only personal
favourites and subjective recommendations.

simply a list of suggestions rather than the definitive authority on
which mechanical keyboards are good.

#### Cherry MX blues

Force Required 	
Medium (50g) 	

'Bump' when pressed? (tactile response) 	
Yes 	

Noisy? (Clicky) 	
Yes 	

Actuation and Reset points
Not together

The Cherry MX Blue switch is considered the touch typists'
switch. Requiring a moderate 50g of force to press (60g peak force),
the Blue switch is finely balanced between accuracy, speed and strain
on the fingers. MX Blues have a distinct tactile bump that helps typists
know when the keys have been activated. The MX Blue switch has a separate
actuation and reset point which makes it more difficult to repeatedly
'tap' a single key than other switches, particularly by users used to
those other switches although many have no issues. The Cherry MX Blue
emits a 'click' when pressed.

The Cherry MX Blue feels the most 'distinct' compared to typing on a
regular rubber dome keyboard. The clicky variant of the Das Professional
Model S is an example of a Cherry MX Blue Keyboard (the Das Professional
Model S also comes with red and brown switch options.)


#### Cherry MX browns


Force Required 	
Light (45g) 	

'Bump' when pressed? (tactile response) 	
Yes, light 	

Noisy? (Clicky) 	
No 	

Actuation and Reset points
Not together but close

The Cherry MX Brown is half way between a gamer's and typist's
switch. Requiring a force of 45g to depress (55g peak force), the key is
not quite as easy to press as the Cherry MX Red. It has a light tactile
feedback, strong enough to let touch typists know when they've pressed the
key but not strong enough to distract gamers from the task at hand. The
actuation and reset point are sufficently close that repeated key presses
are not a problem. Cherry MX Browns do not emit 'clicks' when pressed.

The Logitech G710+ is an example of a Cherry MX Brown Keyboard.

#### Cherry MX red


Force Required 	
Light (45g) 	

'Bump' when pressed? (tactile response) 	
No 	

Noisy? (Clicky) 	
No 	

Actuation and Reset points
Same point

The Cherry MX Red switch is a favourite of gamers and typists who enjoy
the feel of a 'lighter' key. Requiring only 45g of force to depress, the
MX Red is perfect for those who need an instant response to their key
presses or those who's fingers tire after long sessions of typing. The
Cherry MX red switch does not provide tactile feedback and does not emit
'clicks'.

The Cherry MX Red option of the Tesoro Durandal G1NL Ultimate is an
example of a Cherry MX Red keyboard. (The Durandal Ultimate also comes
with a choice of other Cherry switches.)
