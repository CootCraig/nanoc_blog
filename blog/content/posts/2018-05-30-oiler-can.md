<h4>comment - Blacksmith Johnny</h4>

I really like these goldenrod oilers but over time at least mine and I
heard others say the same, that the bases start to wick a little so when
you leave them sit someplace for awhile they leave a ring of lubricant
behind-I take my new ones before using them and put a little loctite
290 wicking sealer in the bottom and swirl it around in the seal in the
bottom,I have one of these with Kroil in it thats  been sitting around
for 5or6 years and it leaves no ring-just my 2 cents. Thanks for the
great videos-cheers

Ray, I have lost two ball oilers using the wrong tip on an oil can. The
G0709 manual specifies a can with a rubber tip to prevent dislodgement
of the ball in the oiler. I have not found an oiler with a rubber tip,
however. A steel tip is specifically mentioned in the manual as a no-no. I
thought plastic would be better than steel and an acceptable substitute
for rubber. Wrong.

Push a short piece of 3/16" standard clear vinyl aquarium tubing over
the spout of your oil can.  Cut it neatly square on the business end
and then push it over  your ball oilers using a thumb and index finger
to seal the connection.  Works great, and still works fine for all your
other oiling jobs, and the vinyl does not scratch stuff.﻿

My most used cutting oil is Oatey Dark Thread cutting Oil from
HomeDepot. One of the best is Lubriplate No. 405 dark cutting Oil,
its expensive but very good.  I also usr the oilers for Way Lube and
Spindle oil for the machines. Hope this helps! Best Regards, Ray﻿
