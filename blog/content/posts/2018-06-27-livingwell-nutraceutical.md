</h3>

Heal-n-Soothe claims to pack both natural anti-inflammation and
anti-oxidation ingredients. The company rides on the fact that
inflammation cause joint pain in our bodies. Heal-n-Soothe is thus
marketed as a product that fights and reduce any inflammation in the
body. It protects the body from free radicals by raising the levels of
proteolytic enzymes. This product is made by a company going by the
name National Enzyme Company but marketed and distributed by Living
Well Nutraceutical.

<h4>Save your money - unethical to do business with By Amazon Customeron March 17, 2016</h4>

<b>Save yourself some money and buy a bottle of just plain Turmeric.</b> It
works wonderful and you don't have all the other herbs which cause side
affects. I believe Jesse Cannone and his company Lose The Back Pain is
a total scam.

<h4>Slimy marketing, but appears to be an effective product By Godo Stoykeon February 23, 2016</h4>

I don't like their website or marketing approach. For example, if you
sign up for a "free" bottle, you pay $10 shipping ($20 international),
and <b>you AUTOMATICALLY get sent one bottle per month for $49</b>. Slimy (I
canceled). I have heard that the "money-back guarantee" does not apply
to opened bottles (what the heck!), and that the bottle only contains a
10-day supply, not a month's supply. Also, the web-site does not inspire
confidence, with the usual garish claims and "testimonials". Having said
that, the product itself appears to work really well. To get relief of
arthritis pain, it seems that 3 capsules per day is the minimum dose,
and it takes about 3 days for the effect to kick in. Several of my family
members have tried it (including myself) and it really seems to work. On
the downside, taking only 1 capsule a day does not appear to be effective,
and if you stop taking it, the pain returns.
