  American Heritage Dictionary
</h2>

James Parton, the publisher (and co-owner) of the history magazine
American Heritage, was appalled by the permissiveness of Webster's Third,
published in 1961, and tried to buy the G. and C. Merriam Company so he
could undo the changes. When that failed, he contracted with Houghton
to publish a new dictionary. The AHD was edited by William Morris and
relied on a usage panel of 105 writers, speakers, and eminent persons
chosen for their well-known conservatism in the use of language.
However, Morris made inconsistent use of the panels, often ignoring
their advice and inserting his own opinions.

The first edition appeared in 1969

The first edition's concise successor, The American Heritage Dictionary,
Second College Edition was published in 1982 (without a larger-format
version). It omitted the Indo-European etymologies, 

but they were reintroduced in the third full edition, published in 1992.
The third edition was also a departure for the publisher because it was
developed in a database, which facilitated the use of the linguistic
data for other applications, such as electronic dictionaries.

The fourth edition (2000, reissued in 2006) added an appendix of Semitic
language etymological roots, and included color illustrations, and was
also available with a CD-ROM edition in some versions. This revision was
larger than a typical desk dictionary but smaller than Webster's Third
New International Dictionary or the unabridged Random House Dictionary of
the English Language. A lower-priced college edition, also the fourth,
was issued in black-and-white printing and with fewer illustrations,
in 2002 (reprinted in 2007 and 2010).
