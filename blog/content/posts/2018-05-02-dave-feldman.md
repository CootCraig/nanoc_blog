<h4>Dave Feldman</h4>

I’m a senior software engineer and entrepreneur.

I began a Low Carb, High Fat diet in April 2015 and have since learned
everything I could about it with special emphasis on cholesterol given
my lipid numbers spiked substantially after going on the diet. As an
engineer, I spotted a pattern in the lipid system that’s very similar
to distributed objects in networks.

I’ve since learned quite a bit on the subject both through research
and experimentation which has revealed some very powerful data. With this
new general theory, I’ve shifted around my cholesterol more than anyone
else in the world without any drugs or special supplements of any kind.

<h4>This site has two primary purposes:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>A resource for those on a Low Carb, High Fat (LCHF) / Ketogenic (Keto) diet who are interested in cholesterol.</li>
  <li>A running blog on my research with regard to cholesterol.</li>
</ul>
