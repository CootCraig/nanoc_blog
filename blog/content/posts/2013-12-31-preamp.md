## Current choices

My hunch is a buffer will end up being the system preamp.

## Bias and gain setting of jBoZ

### [Nelson Pass - situation with the gain, bias, and resistor values](http://www.diyaudio.com/forums/pass-labs/103050-jfet-boz-4.html#post1227215)

Since the question has come up and not answered, the situation with the
gain, bias, and resistor values is as follows.

The device is self biased, and we want the highest value of bias possible
for lowest distortion which makes us want to use a low value Source
resistor to ground.

At the same time, it would be nice to not have too much gain by virtue
of that Source resistor value. The apparent resistance of the JFET is
about 50 ohms, so the gain into a 10 K ohm load is about 1000 / 60 which
is about 24 dB.

We can get lower gain, but the distortion will increase - it's all a
trade-off. I didn't make any effort to exactly optimize these values -
they were just thumbnail calculations.

### [Nelson Pass - best distortion numbers from a 16V supply](http://www.diyaudio.com/forums/pass-labs/103050-jfet-boz-6.html#post1227462)

I measured the circuit this afternoon, and it came out mostly as expected,
but the best distortion numbers came from a 16V supply value.

## Preamp

### MooseFET

### Original MosFET Bride of Zen

[Pass Bride of Zen](https://www.passdiy.com/project/preamplifiers/bride-of-zen)

Due to its extreme simplicity, the Zen amplifier’s interfaced needs to
be indulged a bit, both at the output and also at the input. With respect
to its output, it is designed for an 8 ohm load with an efficiency of
94 dB or greater. I have driven the Zen into Thiel 3.6 loudspeakers,
88 dB efficient at 2.3 ohms, but the result is not pretty. With a pair
of Klipsch speakers it will throw off its mild mannered disguise and
behave like a party animal.

The Zen amp input makes a preamp do a little more work than
usual. Depending on the specific input values, its input impedance is
typically 4.75 KOhm, and it needs about 2.5 volts input to drive it to
full output. Its gain is about 15 dB, which is 10 dB less than most power
amps and it requires more signal from the preamp for equivalent levels.

The point of a preamp circuit here is to function as a gain circuit with a
high input impedance, a low output impedance, and a volume control. This
preamp has a 50 KOhm input impedance, variable gain to about 15 dB,
and will deliver the 2.5 volts at .1% distortion or less.

#### Volume Control

We will place the volume control at the output of the circuit, giving us
a higher output impedance than is typical. Depending on the position of
the volume control, the output impedance will range from 0 to 1.5 KOhms.

Normally you see the volume control potentiometer at the input to the
preamp circuit, and in this way you can insure that the input will not be
overloaded. Placing the potentiometer at the output has two advantages,
however, the first being that all circuit noise will be attenuated as
the volume setting is reduced. Placing the volume control at the output
allows the input of the gain stage to look directly at the source. This
improves the bandwidth and distortion of the circuit by providing a
lower RC figure for the input capacitance of the MOSFET. If you desire
to place a potentiometer at the input of the circuit, feel free to do
so before the input coupling capacitor in place of R107.

Because the input to the Zen amplifier is a resistor operating into a
virtual ground summing junction, it is insensitive to a resistive source
impedance. The gain of the amplifier will alter by the addition of the
source resistance, but the distortion and bandwidth performance will
not change appreciably. A circuit driving the Zen amplifier need not
have a particularly low output impedance, as long as it is resistive
in character.

Is a maximum 1.5 KOhm source impedance a problem? Not in my experience, as
long as it is passive in character, as in the case of this circuit which
has no feedback. You could conceivably see some rolloff at the top end,
but even 1000 pF loading will only take the bandwidth down to 100 KHz.

[Bride of Zen FET Preamplifier - Aren van Waarde](http://www.vt52.com/diy/diypage/aren/zenbride/zenbride.html)

The Bride of Zen, designed by Nelson Pass and described in The Audio
Amateur, 1994, is a very simple line-level preamplifier which contains
just one medium-power MOSFET per channel. It is meant to be used together
with the Zen (or Son of Zen) single-ended MOSFET power amp. A complete
description of the BOZ can be found at http://www.passlabs.com.Mr.Pass
has given a very lucid account of the design philosophy, construction and
alignment (the only alignment consists of adjusting the quiescent current
which should be 40 mA per channel at a supply voltage of +60V). The
lay-out for a printed circuit board can be downloaded from Passlabs.
