There are people — good people who once felt just like you — who
have transformed their own personal histories of digestive problems into
lifelong passions for helping others solve theirs.

People like Dr. Allison Siebecker, a licensed naturopathic doctor who
once wore pants with elastic waistbands to deal with the discomfort of
chronic gas and bloating.

Or Dr. Michael Ruscio, a functional medicine practitioner whose journey
began with insomnia, fatigue, depression, and frequent episodes of
diarrhea that led to his diagnosis of Blastocystis Hominis, a nasty
intestinal parasite infection.

Or Christa Orecchio, a certified nutritionist who spent 8 years of her
life learning how to rid her body of candida overgrowth through her own
independent research and trial-and-error.
