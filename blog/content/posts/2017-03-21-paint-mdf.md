  Finishing MDF
<h4>

One of the best sealers is shellac, but even then it will absorb a lot
of it. Here is a tip….first, sand the area with some 600 grit paper,
like sanding an end grain, it helps to seal down the MDF. Then apply
your sealer coat, shellac does okay, but In this case I used the General
Finishes Under Coater. The under coater is a thick, high solids product
made for sealing down MDF, we also used it on the plywood. A good and
readily available alternative is Zinssers BIN sealer, it’s a shellac
based, high solids primer and does very well. When you apply the first
coat of any product don’t expect it to be very pretty, it’s going to
raise the fiber and look rough. It’s normal, the key is to let it dry
well and then sand it back smooth using  some 220 and then re-coat. The
sealer has to harden the fiber and then when sanded it’s hard enough
that the sandpaper will shear it off leaving a smooth surface. When you
re-coat you may get a little of the same, but usually not much and when
sanded smooth it remains. Another big key is to not break the seal coat,
in other words, don’t sand through the sealer. Apply some more, you
do not want to see the MDF, it needs to be fully sealed in.
