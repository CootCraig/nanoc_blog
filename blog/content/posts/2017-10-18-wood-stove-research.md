Bob Fisher had some basic criteria that he wanted from his stove, and his wife supplied some of her own:

<ul>
  <li>It had to be an airtight wood stove</li>
  <li>Ventilation needed to be restricted and controlable with vents</li>
  <li>It had to be able to keep a fire in over night</li>
  <li>Carol wanted to be able to cook on the top of the stove</li>
  <li>The stove couldn't smoke when the door was opened</li>
  <li>The Fisher Stove had to last - this called for heavy duty steel and firebrick</li>
</ul>

This heater is highly efficient which make this stove very
attractive. Most people who buy this wood-burning stove enjoy it and
keep it for ridiculously long periods of time. The wood burns on a bed of
ash, rather than having some sort of grate. This has been said to be the
best way of burning wood in a stove. A built-in, yet extremely effective
airwash system keeps the large windows clean and free of condensation,
allowing you to enjoy the large view of the fire.

<h4>Nate Surveyor</h4>

Fisher Grandpa model. 20" log.

PAPA model. It takes a 28" log.

our old camper school bus has a BABY Bear in it. 

Here is some of the Fisher Story at
<a href="http://www.hearth.com/econtent/index.php/wiki/Fisher_Stoves" target="_blank">hearth.com/econtent/</a>

<h4>beenthere</h4>

For our great room, have a Defiant Vermont Castings, with catalytic converter...Heats well, and wood lasts a long time.

<h4>WDH</h4>

I have an Earth Stove by Colony Hearth in my house.  It heats great.

<h4>Grawulf</h4>

We have had two Timberlines over the years - very similar to the Fishers,
they were the cream of the crop back in the '70s. We replaced it with
a Hearthstone soapstone last year - took some getting used to learning
how to fire it but it sure is nice to have a warm stove when you get up
in the morning.

<h4>Larry</h4>

Ran an Earthstove for a few years and thought it was comparable to
a Fisher.

Been using a Vermont Castings Defiant Encore for the last 17 years.
The top loading and ash pan clean out make it a very easy to operate
stove.  Heat output is second to none.  The catalytic converter is a
gimmick meant to please the EPA and the greenies.

<h4>WH_Conley</h4>

I have used Ashley and Wondercoal with very good results. Got to get a
coal stove or get a catalyis(sp) converter. Not the prettiest stoves on
the market but they are affordible and efficient. Speaking of efficient
I don't buy wood, I can'r burn 1/5 of the leavings from the mill. Might
be different if I was buying firewood.

<h4>tim1234</h4>

I have a Jotul Oslo F500 Firelight.  My friends own a hardware store
and specialize in BBQs and Fireplaces.  Their opinion after going to
all the trade shows and looking at all the stoves is that the Jotul has
the best looking flame.  I love to watch the flames as it looks like
the flame is pouring up out of the wood.  It is a not catalitic stove.
If you burn too hot you can damage the catalitic insert and they need
to be replaced periodically.  They recommended the Jotul and I have
not been dissapointed.  They are a swedish stove and have a very nicely
detailed casting so they look good even when you're not burning anything.
I heat my 2000 sq ft home all winter alomost exclusively with the stove.

<h4>RSteiner</h4>

That stove was just replaced a month ago with a Jotul Oslo.  I really like
the Jotul stove it has one moving part, the draft control.  Although it
was not a factor when looking at stoves the viewing window in the front
of the stove makes you want to sit, relax, and enjoy the view.  I looked
at the new Lopi cast iron stove but the fact that the castings were made
in China was the main reason for going with the Jotul.

<h4>Ron Wenrich</h4>

I have a Woodstock Soapstone stove.  I've had it for about 25 years.
It has a cast metal frame, and 1" of soapstone on the sides and top.
It will keep heat all night.  It doesn't use a great deal of wood.

</h4>

Morso are famous in Europe and I know they sell in the USA and Canada,
they are a high quality cast iron stove manufacturer. Jotul are brilliant
and I have toured their factory in Norway, I could post some photos if you
like? Our f118 nearly heats all the home and never needs rekindled. I ve
owned many stoves and i think jotul and morso are the best, maybe jotul
has the edge, slightly, just my own view. Willy Campbell is a star,
I m sure I m related to him !

  Lopi Endeavor
</h4>

The Endeavor has been a top-selling wood stove since 1984 because it
combines form and function with an excellent heat transfer system. This
wood burning stove is ideal for heating medium to large sized homes
and living spaces. It has one of the cleanest burning fireboxes of any
mid-sized wood stove. The firebox can also hold logs up to 18″ in
length and provides longer burn times.

The Endeavor offers the closest clearance of any wood stove in the
industry – as close as 4-1/4″ to a rear combustible surface. In
addition, startups are easy with the bypass damper..

The Endeavor comes available with GreenStart, a patent-pending
ignition system that allows you to load your wood and push a button to
start! We’ve completely eliminated slow, cracked open door startups
and fighting with fickle newspaper.

One of the great features of a Lopi wood stove is the cooktop surface. The Endeavor not only heats your home, but your food too!

<p>
Well, I think first of all, if absolute heat output is a prime concern,
then a stove with a larger firebox would serve best. Of the stoves you
mention, the Blaze King, King model (they also make a Princess but it
is considerably smaller) has the largest firebox and will simply hold
more firewood and so deliver more heat per full load. It seems to be a
very nice stove and was on my short list three years ago when I was in
the market.
</p>

<p>
I ended up buying an Ideal Steel, it has served very well and I am very
pleased with it. The Progress hybrid was also on my short list.
</p>

<p>
A couple of points you may want to consider: A front opening door is
much easier to clean the glass. A side opening door is usually easier
to fill and will result in less smoke spillage into the house. This is
only a consideration for the Progress hybrid as it is the only side
loading door stove on your list. It is also a medium size stove, and
the smallest on your list.
</p>

<p>
The Blaze King King has a huge firebox, is a catalytic based stove and
has a huge base of very satisfied customers. No question in my mind
that it would provide the most heat per load (such as for overnight)
of the stoves you list, plus it has an automatic damper which apparently
works quite well. A couple of downsides are: 1) it requires an 8" chimney
(flue). They used to list a 6" flue as an option but that seems to have
been removed. My suggestion would be to call them if you are planning
on using that stove on a 6" chimney. 2) it does not have a grate and so
requires ashes be shoveled out, or a plug removed and the ashes shifted
through that hole when the stove is mostly empty. A grate in a stove
with a sealed ashpan (Ideal Steel or Progress for example) is easier to
clean the ash out of it while it is actually running. 3) the combustors
are expensive for a B.K.K. at ~$375 or so. Blaze King will claim up
to 10 years for combustor life buy my experience is more like 2 years
or so and so the cost of the combustor you will need for any stove you
are considering becomes important over, say, 10 years or more of owning
and using the stove. 4) the Blaze King King is a little more difficult
to remove the combustor for occasional cleaning while an Ideal Steel,
for example, allows the combustor to be removed in a matter of seconds
with no tool whatsoever. 5) If running very low and slow, I think the
Ideal Steel is the best design to run cleanly because the combustor is
located directly over the top / center of the firebox and so is easier
to keep 'lit'.
</p>

<p>
There is one other stove that I considered carefully, and it is a very
direct competitor (IMO) to a Blaze King King; that stove is the Regency
5100 It also has a huge firebox, about the same as a B.K.K., is combustor
based but is also a hybrid stove with a secondary burn ability. A very
nice looking stove, very well made, from a company with an outstanding
reputation and a limited lifetime warranty (!!). I suggest you check
one of those out as well; I have seen one in person at a local dealer
and in some ways like it better than the B.K.K. although it does not
have the automatic draft feature of the Blaze King.
</p>

<p>
In the end, I would suggest considering what you really need out of a
stove and try to solve that problem (or those problems) directly. You
specifically mention your wife is cold, you want more heat out of a
stove and long burn times so again, a big firebox is what will deliver
there. There is no magic method by which a small to medium stove can
possibly compete with a large firebox. My own choice would be for a
cat. based or hybrid type of stove, which is all that you mention in
your list. As I read your post, I tend to think the B.K.K. would best
serve you and your family, especially during those very cold Minnesnowta
winters. :) I live in the northeast and while we have 'real' winters,
they are not nearly as cold as I think yours will be and that extra cubic
foot of firebox will almost certainly have a great value. Especially so
if you do not have ready and easy access to long burning hardwoods.

  BDF on digital probes he uses
</h4>

Yep, lots 'o posts about the IS and they wander around regarding topic.

To use a 'digital' probe (thermocouple) you will also need some type
of display or recording device. I use these probes: 
<a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-3-Meter-High-Temperature-100-1250-C-Thermocouple-K-type-100mm-Probe-Sensor-/161320380555?hash=item258f71a88b:g:HjoAAOSwImRYgZU0" target="_blank">New 3 Meter High Temperature -100~1250 C Thermocouple K type 100mm Probe Sensor | eBay</a>
They are 8 mm on the threaded section so the hole for the thermometer on
the IS must be drilled out and tapped (Oy Vei- my probe is too big for the
hole! (Easy Boys)) to accept it. Note that these do not have standard K-
type ends so you will have to buy some of those too and screw the wires
to the adapters, not a big deal and the adapters are inexpensive.

Then I use one of these to read the thermocouples: 
<a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/181308707621?lpid=82&chn=ps&ul_noapp=true" target="_blank">4 Channel K Type Digital Thermocouple Thermometer Measurer SD Logger Generic | eBay</a>
They are nice because they are 4 channel and record data on SD cards. This
can be useful is you want to see how different settings affect an
overnight burn for example- you can see the temperature of the cat.,
firebox, stove top and flue gas all at once for hours, days or even weeks
at one time. I think it is what allows us to get the most out of a stove.

DVL's double-wall, air-insulated design reduces clearances to combustibles
from 18" to 6", the closest clearance to a wall of any connector pipe. DVL
improves stove performance by maintaining high flue gas temperatures
for a strong, steady draft. Because the inner wall is stainless steel
the flue heats up faster, stays hot longer, minimizes the formation of
creosote, and has the same life expectancy as the chimney. Adjustable
lengths eliminate the need for cutting or crimping.

Applications - Double-wall interior stovepipe for connecting wood stoves to manufactured chimney.

Materials and Construction

.016" stainless steel inner wall.

UL1618

With stoves burning cleaner and hotter than ever before, a traditional
ember protector or homemade hearth may not protect the combustible floor
beneath your stove. Building codes and safety standards now require the
hearth pad to provide adequate protection based on the stove model. With
that in mind, we now offer two levels of protection to meet the needs of
every stove. All our pads are tested to meet or exceed UL1618. Whether
you’re burning gas, pellets, corn, coal, oil or wood, our hearth pads
offer the best protection on the market - and they look great too.

<h4>Thermal Protection</h4>

For today’s highly efficient stoves, a Hearth Classics non-combustible
ThermaShield pad will block the heat from passing through to your sub
floor. Fully non-combustible, with an R-value of 1.61, it provides the
greatest protection of any manufactured hearth pad. For stoves requiring
an R-value higher than R=1.61, a ThermaShield Low-Profile base, a
ThermaShield Pedestal, or a ThermaShield Xtreme Pedestal can increase the
protection up to R=10. All our pads are tested to meet or exceed UL1618.

How thick are your hearth pads?
Tiled pads are 1¼” thick. Stone and Brick pads are 1½” thick.

I used 1/2" micore & 1/4 Durok and has no issues. Make sure you use
the screws required for cement board, and be be generous with them. I
think I used them every 6" to 8" apart. And 6' along the edges. I have
had no issues with the microre compressing or such. I put 1/2" x 18"
square natural slate on mine.

<h5>begreen</h5>

An alternative is to use higher R value Durock which is R=.39 for
1/2". 3 layers will easily exceed the required hearth R-value. Use of
latex modified thinset is fine and recommended.

<h5>mol1jb</h5>
 
The last 2 tile jobs I have used Hardibacker over Durock as a personal
preference, including my current hearth and stove install which I also
used slate tile.

<h5>begreen</h5>

It will work when ember protection only is needed, though not my
preference. Hardibacker is R=.26 vs Durock NexGen at R=.39.

Skip the in between layers of hardibacker. Instead start with a 1/2"

<h4>Help with research on stove selection</h4>

Tue Jan  9 11:27:29 MST 2018

My wife and I recently moved to a small town and into a 1 1/2 story home built in 1914.  The lot is about 1 acre so there is space to process and stack firewood.  There is a non working pellet stove in place, but I see no evidence of a previous wood stove.

There are a number of issues for me to research before we purchase and install a wood stove.  I'd like to get advice on stoves for us to consider.

I am looking for a new hybrid stove with a fire box about 3 cu. ft.  The current short list is Woodstock Ideal Steel, Regency F3500, Hearthstone Manchester

I prefer the Ideal Steel. My wife likes the look of the Hearthstone Manchester, but the Ideal Steal not so much.  She really likes the sculpted cast iron look in black.

I'm making my best case for a undecorated black IS but would like help in getting a list of stoves to consider and in particular what stoves might look attractive to my wife and have the efficiency and ease of maintenance I'm looking for.
