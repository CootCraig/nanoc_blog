## <a href="https://surplus.motionconstrained.com/about-us/" target="_blank">motionconstrained about page</a>

Motion Constrained has been operating as a surplus automation dealer
for a little over 10 years. We run an eBay power-seller store with 100%
feedback and are now expanding to our own website so we can offer our
customers even better deals.

Our goal is to source high quality automation products at the lowest
possible prices to offer hobbyists and smaller businesses the ability
to build and operate industrial quality equipment. We strive to never
sacrifice performance or accuracy while still sourcing the cheapest
possible manufacturing components.
