#### Microfiber Towels â€” What You Should Know About Them <a href="http://www.carwashmag.com/issues/feb-2011/detail-management.cfm" target="_blank">Auto Laundry News - February 2011</a>

##### 80/20 vs. 70/30

Initially it was believed that the 70/30 blend was superior and
more absorbent than the 80/20 because it contained a higher amount
of nylon. However, as the technology has advanced, the two blends have
become nearly identical in their abilities. Today, most do not consider
the 70/30 blend superior. They are so close to one another in cleaning and
absorbing capabilities that it is very difficult to tell any difference
between them, and there is no significant price difference.

The reason for the difference has to do with where the towels are
produced. The 70/30 type is common to European manufacturers, while the
80/20 comes from Asian countries.

##### THE SPLIT

So if the ratio of polyester to poly-amide does not affect quality,
what does? It is the amount of splits, or pie segments, per fiber.

There are two different types of microfiber: split and
non-split. Non-split is used for furniture-upholstery material or shirts,
but it does not have cleaning properties like split microfiber. The more
splits it has, the more effective as a cleaning towel.

It is determined that the most effective microfiber towel on the market
contains 16 segments per fiber. Microfiber containing fewer splits is
also available to the detail and car wash industries at a lesser cost.

##### WEIGHT

The final criterion to use when judging microfiber towels is the weight
of the cloth. All fibers are weighed in deniers, the weight in grams of a
9,000-meter-long strand of any fiber. An individual microfiber filament
weighs less than one denier. As comparisons: microfiber filaments are
half the diameter of a silk fiber, a third the diameter of a cotton fiber,
and a quarter the diameter of wool.

Microfiber filaments are thinner than 1 percent of the thickness of a
human hair, and can be densely woven together. Each cloth consists of
approximately 200,000 microfiber filaments per square inch.

Weight is the best way to judge the quality of a microfiber towel. The
fibers themselves are weighed in denier, but the towel as a whole is
weigh-ed in grams per square meter. Good quality is about 200 grams per
square meter; 250 to 280 is better quality; the best products are 400
grams per square meter or more.

Weight dictates how long it will take for the towel to show wear and
tear. The heavier the weight, the more fiber it has. The more fiber it
has, the longer it will last. All microfiber is basically the same. It
becomes a question of economy and durability, or how many washings it is
going to last. A heavier towel will last longer and survive more washings.

Although heavier microfiber is superior to lightweight, microfiber
is still lighter than other woven cloths. Microfiber towels do not
require the same pressure or force as a cotton towel, so there is a
great reduction in the wear and tear on the towel.

Identifying the right microfiber for the job depends on more than just
price. The number of splits, weight, and durability all play an important
role in determining microfiber quality.
