In many ways, the CHART OF ACCOUNTS you use for your business accounting
will determine or, at the least, significantly impact (1) the amount of
effort involved in doing the accounting process for your business and (2)
the amount and quality of the information you get out of that process. Too
much detail will multiply your workload, while too little detail will mask
critical information that is required for understanding your financial
information and making critical business decisions. A properly structured
Chart of Accounts can help you manage your business more effectively!

The following is a descriptive outline of the generic Chart of Accounts
we recommend for our clients. It lists the Balance Sheet and Income
Statement accounts needed to properly account for most small businesses
like yours. You will note that, in certain critical areas such as Sales,
Cost of Sales, and Payroll Expense, this listing contains only a range
of account numbers. These sections reflect the "personality" of your
business and are unique to each company. We will be happy to sit down
with you and carefully structure these sections of your own Chart of
Accounts, to help minimize your accounting efforts and maximize the
critical management information you need to run your business.

Nonprofit organizations often receive funding from individual donors
and other outside support. The need for clarity and disclosure becomes
evident when soliciting contributions. However, whether the nonprofit
seeks donors or not, a key part of managing any successful endeavor that
involves taking in revenue and distributing services or products is a
solid accounting system.
