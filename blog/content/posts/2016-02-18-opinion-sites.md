Captain Capitalism - Rantings and tirades of a frustrated economist.

<a href="https://soundcloud.com/aaron-clarey/" target="_blank">Aaron Clarey podcast</a>


My name is Aaron Clarey and welcome to the flagship product of my little
"online media empire" - Captain Capitalism.

Captain Capitalism has a nerdy, pathetic, and sad origin.  I was sick
of being the only conservative at parties during my 20's in the leftist
shithole known as Minneapolis.  Not because I was a conservative, but
because any time I'd attend a party,

invariably, some drunk liberal would out me, a debate would ensue, I'd
mop the floor with him, finish the debate, and then kill the party's
buzz worse than Buzz Killington.

So, to make quick word of the debates that were sure to ensue I decided
to start burning CD's with some key charts and data that always seemed
to be at the nucleus of the debates I was having, and thusly put a quick
end to them so the party may go on.

Then Blogger came about.

Blogger was an easier format to store my key charts.  So instead of
having to lug CD's around, all I had to do was upload the charts and data,
having them conveniently there in anticipation an emasculated Minneapolis
leftist putz of a man decided to play "smear the conservative" in a vain
attempt to impress chicks.

From there it basically became a platform for me to yell, vent, and scream
at the idiocy I saw around me.  Never thought it would lead anywhere,
but it did.  Apparently I wasn't the only guy on teh interwebz thinking
the same thing.  Soon links were made, traffic exchanged, books were
written, and in 2011 I was making enough money on this crazy blog I
could tell my boss to pound sand.

## Roosh V (Daryush Valizadeh)

<a href="http://www.rooshv.com/" target="_blank">web site</a>

I am 36 years old and grew up in Maryland, USA. My full name is Daryush
Valizadeh (it’s Persian). My birthday is on Flag Day, a national
holiday.

After I graduated from the University of Maryland with a degree in
microbiology, I began a career as an industrial microbiologist. A
couple years later I started a local blog called DC Bachelor, and
lived in constant paranoia that my employer would bust me for the macho
content. Eventually I changed the name to Roosh V because I no longer
cared about getting fired.

products, children's toys and other items.

Natural News covers holistic health, nutritional therapies, consciousness
and spirituality, permaculture , organics, animal rights, environmental

corporate corruption, animal testing, the use of humans for medical

Natural News also warns its readers about science gone bad and frequently
cites examples of science resulting in catastrophies that it calls
"crimes" against humanity. Examples of such subjects cited by Natural
News include:
