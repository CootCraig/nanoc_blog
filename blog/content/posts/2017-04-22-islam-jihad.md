RAYMOND IBRAHIM is a widely published author, public speaker, and Middle
East and Islam specialist.  His books include The Al Qaeda Reader
(Doubleday, 2007), Crucified Again: Exposing Islam’s New War on
Christians (Regnery, 2013), and Sword and Scimitar: Fourteen Centuries
of War between Islam and the West (Da Capo, Spring 2018).

Ibrahim’s dual-background—born and raised in the U.S. by Coptic
Egyptian parents born and raised in the Middle East—has provided
him with unique advantages, from equal fluency in English and Arabic,
to an equal understanding of the Western and Middle Eastern mindsets,
positioning him to explain the latter to the former. His interest in
Islamic civilization was first piqued when he began visiting the Middle
East as a child in the 1970s. Interacting and conversing with the locals
throughout the decades has provided him with an intimate appreciation
for that part of the world, complementing his academic training.

  Can Islam ever be reformed? By Nonie Darwish
</h4>

Muslim reformer Zuhdi Jasser has recently attacked leaders of the anti-Jihad movement in America.

In 2007 a horrific article was written against Wafa Sultan and myself
in the cover of a prominent Egyptian magazine Rose El Yousef, in which
we were both condemned as “apostates” who are just as bad as Muslim
terrorists, Taliban leaders and the blind Sheikh, Omar Abdel-Rahman,
who caused the 1993 world trade center bombing. Note that the Egyptian
magazine did not place a photo of Usama Bin Laden, because he was popular
among many Muslims.

<h1>History of Islamic Conquest</h1>

<h2>711 to 788 - Umayyad conquest of Hispania</h2>

<h4>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_conquest_of_Hispania" target="_blank">wikipedia.org/wiki</a>
  Umayyad conquest of Hispania
</h4>

Forces commanded by Tariq ibn Ziyad disembarked in early 711 at Gibraltar
at the head of an army consisting of Berbers (north-western Africa). He
campaigned his way northward after the decisive Battle of Guadalete
against the usurper Roderic, after which he was reinforced by an Arab
force led by his superior wali Musa ibn Nusair. By 717, the combined
force had crossed the Pyrenees into Septimania and Provence (734).

<h2>Battle of Toulouse (721)</h2>

<h4>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Toulouse_%28721%29" target="_blank">wikipedia.org/wiki</a>
  Battle of Toulouse (721)
</h4>

The Battle of Toulouse (721) was a victory of an Aquitanian Christian
army led by Duke Odo of Aquitaine over an Umayyad Muslim army besieging
the city of Toulouse, and led by the governor of Al-Andalus, Al-Samh
ibn Malik al-Khawlani. The victory checked the spread of Umayyad control
westward from Narbonne into Aquitaine.

<h4>Aftermath</h4>

Arab historians agree that the Battle of Toulouse was a total
disaster. After the defeat, some Umayyad officials and soldiers managed
to escape, among them Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi. However, the clash halted
indefinitely the Umayyad expansion northwards. Al-Andalus was at the
time re-organising into a new after-Gothic order. The Umayyads kept the
military initiative raiding several times the south of Gaul (up to Autun
in 725), but avoided new serious campaigns into the north-west.

Odo's victory earned him widespread renown in Aquitaine and recognition
abroad, he came up reinforced. He was hailed as champion of Christianity
by the Pope in Rome, and was even presented with gifts. Charles steered
clear of the political and military developments in the south of Gaul
for another 10 years, until 732.

The fateful engagement, the so-called Balat Al Shuhada of Toulouse,
would be still remembered in memorials by Al-Andalus Muslims for the
following 450 years, as opposed to the Battle of Poitiers, held as a
minor battle.

<h4>Discussion</h4>

Some historians believe that the Battle of Toulouse halted the Muslim
conquest of Europe even more than the later—and more celebrated—Battle
of Tours (10 October 732, between Tours and Poitiers), but this is highly
problematic: for even had the Arabs won at Toulouse, they still would
have had to conquer the Franks to retain control of the region. However,
nearly all historians agree that the Christian victory at Toulouse was
important in a macrohistorical sense in that it gave Charles Martel badly
needed time to strengthen his grip on power and build the veteran army
which stood him in such good stead eleven years later at Tours. The eleven
years between Toulouse and Tours without question gave him time to fully
secure power, inspire the loyalty of his troops, and, most importantly,
drill the core of veterans who stood so stoutly in 732.

While Odo faded into history after his horrific defeat at Bordeaux,
the Battle of Toulouse is important as it bought time for Martel to
prepare for the invasion mounted by Abd al Rahman in 732. However, others
(e.g. Archibald Lewis, Roger Collins, etc.) hold that Umayyad attacks
were raids or razzias, like the one reaching as far north as Autun in
725, and not real attempts to conquer Francia. Ironically, while Odo is
forgotten, Martel was hailed in later times as the "savior of Europe"
by many Western and European authors and academic figures.

<h2>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_River_Garonne" target="_blank">wikipedia.org/wiki</a>
  Battle of the River Garonne, also known as the Battle of Bordeaux
</h2>

The Battle of the River Garonne, also known as the Battle of Bordeaux,
was fought in 732 between an Umayyad army led by Abdul Rahman Al
Ghafiqi, governor of Al-Andalus, and Aquitanian forces led by Duke Odo
of Aquitaine.

<h4>The battle</h4>

Following the victory at Bordeaux, Abdul Rahman engaged Odo's forces
on the Garonne River, or possibly at the Dordogne River, in his march
northward. Abdul Rahman's army was numbered 70,000 to 80,000 and defeated
Odo, according to Benett. However, such huge figures on the tradition
of medieval chronicles have been questioned, since the expedition was
an unusually large raid against the Aquitanian duke Odo (Lewis, A.R.;
Collins, R.). The defeat was comprehensive and most of Odo's forces were
wiped out or ran in disarray, after which the Umayyads looted the rich
monasteries of northern Aquitaine before resuming their march towards
Tours, a town said to be holding abundant wealth and treasures.

<h4>Aftermath</h4>

This plundering gave Odo enough time to re-organise his Aquitanian troops
and according to chronicles notified Charles of the impending danger to
the Frankish kingdom. The Frankish leader took notice, accepted Odo's
formal submission and Odo joined Charles's army to form its left wing. The
Umayyad armies were finally defeated by forces (size of the two armies
is debated by modern historians) led by Charles Martel at the Battle of
Tours that took place somewhere between Poitiers and Tours on 10 October,
732 (or 733 according to latest research).

The farthest reaching political consequences of this defeat were Charles
Martel's intervention in Aquitaine, the temporary end of Basque-Aquitanian
sovereignty and Odo's formal submission to Charles, confirmed after the
Battle of Tours-Poitiers.

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tours" target="_blank">wikipedia.org/wiki</a>
  732AD - Battle of Tours
</h2>

The Battle of Tours (10 October 732) — also called the Battle of
Poitiers and, by Arab sources, the Battle of the Palace of the Martyrs

The Battle of Tours followed two decades of Umayyad conquests in Europe
which had begun with the invasion of the Visigothic Christian Kingdoms
of the Iberian Peninsula in 711. These were followed by military
expeditions into the Frankish territories of Gaul, former provinces of
the Roman Empire. Umayyad military campaigns had reached northward into
Aquitaine and Burgundy, including a major engagement at Bordeaux and a
raid on Autun. Charles's victory is widely believed to have stopped the
northward advance of Umayyad forces from the Iberian Peninsula, and to
have preserved Christianity in Europe during a period when Muslim rule
was overrunning the remains of the old Roman and Persian Empires.

<h4>Moors</h4>

The invasion of Hispania, and then Gaul, was led by the Umayyad
Dynasty (Arabic: بنو أمية banū umayya / الأمويون
al-umawiyyūn‎‎ also "Umawi"), the first dynasty of caliphs of the
Islamic empire after the reign of the Rashidun Caliphs (Abu Bakr, Umar,
Uthman, and Ali) ended. The Umayyad Caliphate, at the time of the Battle
of Tours, was perhaps the world's foremost military power. Great expansion
of the Caliphate occurred under the reign of the Umayyads. Muslim armies
pushed east across Persia and west across North Africa through the late
7th century.

In 711-18, Tariq ibn Ziyad led forces across the Strait of Gibraltar to
conquer the Visigothic Kingdom of Hispania. The Muslim empire under the
Umayyads was now a vast domain that ruled a diverse array of peoples. It
had destroyed what were the two former foremost military powers, the
Sasanian Empire, which it absorbed completely, and the greater part of
the Byzantine Empire, including Syria, Armenia and North Africa, although
Leo the Isaurian stemmed the tide when he defeated the Umayyads at the
Battle of Akroinon (739), their final campaign in Anatolia.

<h4>Franks</h4>

The Frankish realm under Charles Martel was the foremost military power of
Western Europe. During most of his tenure in office as commander-in-chief
of the Franks, it consisted of north and eastern France (Austrasia,
Neustria and Burgundy), most of western Germany, and the Low Countries
(Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands). The Frankish realm had begun
to progress towards becoming the first real imperial power in western
Europe since the fall of Rome. However, it continued to struggle against
external forces such as the Saxons, Frisians, and other opponents such
as the Basque-Aquitanians led by Odo the Great (Old French: Eudes),
Duke over Aquitaine and Vasconia.
