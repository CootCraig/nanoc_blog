### allaboutcircuits.com - Is the surface of water ever "perfectly" flat?

#### Glenn Holland

Except for surface tension at the edges and with no motion, the surface
should be almost flat.

Other liquids such as molten tin exhibit near flatness and the surface can
be used as a reference and also a mold for casting other flat shapes. s
an example, plate glass is made by applying molten glass over the surface
of molten tin.

<b>Float glass</b> is a sheet of glass made by floating molten glass
on a bed of molten metal, typically tin, although lead and various low
melting point alloys were used in the past. This method gives the sheet
uniform thickness and very flat surfaces. Modern windows are made from
float glass. Most float glass is soda-lime glass, but relatively minor
quantities of specialty borosilicate[1] and flat panel display glass are
also produced using the float glass process.[2] The float glass process
is also known as the Pilkington process, named after the British glass
manufacturer Pilkington, which pioneered the technique (invented by Sir
Alastair Pilkington) in the 1950s.

As of 2009, the world float glass market, not including China and
Russia, is dominated by the four companies: Asahi Glass, NSG/Pilkington,
Saint-Gobain, and Guardian Industries. Other companies include Sise
Cam AS, PPG, Central Glass, Hankuk (HanGlas), Zeledyne, and Cardinal
Glass Industries.

### instructables.com - Cast Tin

I got an order for some tin cubes. I found that there wasn't an
instructable for casting tin, so I recorded my steps and went through
it for you all to see.

Why tin? Tin melts very low in temperature. Basically, the lowest melting
point of any useful, non-toxic metal(*). It melts around 500 degrees,
is very castable, and looks brilliant. There's only one real good reason
not to use it: it's relatively expensive. I got mine from Rotometals in
San Leandro for around $10/lb. Its density is similar to lead.
