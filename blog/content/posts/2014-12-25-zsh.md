- forked oh-my-zsh and added to dotfiles.
After some time with zsh / oh-my-zsh
I expect to switch to zgen, a zsh plugin manager.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
zsh --version
zsh 5.0.7 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Change login shell to zsh

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cat /etc/shells
/etc/shells: valid login shells
/bin/sh
/bin/dash
/bin/bash
/bin/rbash
/usr/bin/tmux
/bin/zsh
/usr/bin/zsh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
chsh -s /bin/zsh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Conclusion

oh-my-zsh has always had noble intentions, yet it has fallen short as it
has grown. I feel that a better, more sustainable solution is required
for managing plugins in zsh.

Antigen so far has been a great attempt at that and my chosen tool to
remedy these shortcomings of oh-my-zsh. As mentioned, it isn’t without
its flaws but that is expected of projects; the base features are there
which is far more important.

The manual way

### 1. Clone the repository as a submodule in ~/dotfiles

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cd ~/dotfiles
git submodule add -b craig git@github.com:CootCraig/oh-my-zsh.git .oh-my-zsh
git submodule update --init
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update later

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cd ~/dotfiles
git submodule update --remote
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### 2. Optionally, backup your existing ~/.zshrc file:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.orig
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### 3. Create a new Zsh config file by copying the Zsh template we’ve provided:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### 4. Set Zsh as your default shell:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
chsh -s /bin/zsh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### 5. Start or restart Zsh by opening a new command-line window.

## git submodule to

## zgen - zsh plugin manager

* [github - tarjoilija/zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen)

A lightweight plugin manager for ZSH inspired by Antigen. Our goal is to
have a minimal overhead when starting up the shell because nobody likes
waiting. The script generates a static init.zsh file which does nothing
but sources your plugins and appends them to fpath. The downside is that
you have to update your plugins manually.
