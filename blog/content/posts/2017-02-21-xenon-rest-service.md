  Xenon - Decentralized Control Plane Framework

<h3>1.1 Xenon Highlights</h3>

Xenon is a framework for writing small REST-based services. (Some people
call them microservices.) The runtime is implemented in Java and acts
as the host for the lightweight, asynchronous services. The programming
model is language agnostic (does not rely on Java specific constructs) so
implementations in other languages are encouraged. The services can run on
a set of distributed nodes. Xenon provides replication, synchronization,
ordering, and consistency for the state of the services. Because of
the distributed nature of Xenon, the services scale well and are highly
available.

Xenon is a "batteries included" framework. Unlike some frameworks that
provide just consistent data replication or just a microservice framework,
Xenon provides both. Xenon services have REST-based APIs and are backed
by a consistent, replicated document store.
