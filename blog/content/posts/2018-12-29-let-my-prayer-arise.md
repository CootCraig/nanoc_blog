  Let My Prayer Arise
</h2>

The Psalter According to the Seventy translated and published by Holy Transfiguration Monastery in Boston.

For this reason, in these meditations, we will use the Greek-based text
of the Psalter in the version called The Psalter According to the Seventy
translated and published by Holy Transfiguration Monastery in Boston. The
value of using this version in our private prayers is that it is also a
version commonly used in many of the liturgical settings of the Church,
so that when we go from our homes to the Church these same words will
be easily recognized and will make deeper impression over time, both on
heart and on memory,

When we come together next time we will begin moving through the
Psalms themselves. I encourage you to listen with the Psalm text before
you. Begin to read and then to memorize so that soon you can meditate
on each Psalm before moving on to another.
