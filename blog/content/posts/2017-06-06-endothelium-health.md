  Endothelium
</h1>

Endothelium is a type of epithelium that lines the interior surface
of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, forming an interface between
circulating blood or lymph in the lumen and the rest of the vessel
wall. It is a thin layer of simple squamous cells called endothelial
cells. Endothelial cells in direct contact with blood are called vascular
endothelial cells, whereas those in direct contact with lymph are known
as lymphatic endothelial cells.

Vascular endothelial cells line the entire circulatory system, from the
heart to the smallest capillaries. These cells have unique functions
in vascular biology. These functions include fluid filtration, such
as in the glomerulus of the kidney, blood vessel tone, hemostasis,
neutrophil recruitment, and hormone trafficking. Endothelium of the
interior surfaces of the heart chambers is called endocardium.
