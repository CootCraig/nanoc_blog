<h4>Overall very happy with the Lansky....  ByRobPHXon October 26, 2017</h4>

After watching multiple YouTube videos I sat down with about 5 knives that
were in desperate need of a sharpening. The knives ranged from a high end
Benchmade, a S30V Spyderco, a "free knife with purchase of membership"
knife and a roughly 10" expensive professional chefs knife(the brand
with Japanese letters and a visably hammer dented design/finish). After
an hour, maybe closer to 2 I had finished all the knives. They all were
razor sharp and passed every test one does to check sharpness(shaving
hair, gliding through flimsy phonebook paper etc).

The Lansky isn't perfect. It could be improved in a few areas but
overall I think it is well worth the price and I have zero desire to
buy anything more $$ or "better". One issue was the inability to lock
the knife in the clamp perfectly. On occaision the knife would pivot
and need remounted. I found it mainly wanted to move when using a rough
grit and a heavy stroke like you would use when reprofiling an edge. It
isn't really a big deal and only takes a few seconds to put the knife
back in position. I also found the clamp to have some sharp edges and
after a knife or two my hand was getting sore....this is when using it on
the table clamp mount. Even on the mount you still need a tightly hold
the clamp to keep it from moving and to keep the guide rods pressed to
the top of the holes(a good method for being as precise and consistent
with each stroke, another is the oil is for CLEANING the stones, not for
lubricating them during use). I ended up with glove on my left hand for
a little padding.

In addition to this set I also purchased the table clamp mount, the
super sapphire stone and the leather strop as well. All good products
and somewhat necessary in my opinion if you REALLY want your knife as
sharp as possible. Both the sapphire stone and leather strop seem to be
needed to bring the edge to a mirror like surface free of scratches.

As I said before I am pleased with the Lansky kit. My knives went from
very dull after years of use to razor sharp. The chefs knife was a
massive improvment and the change in performance was amazing. Prior
to sharpening it would tend to crush vegetables and needed a real
saw like cutting style to get through. After sharpening it cut thru
effortlessly...even veggies like tomatoes and jalapeños which have a
bit of a thicker skin. I'd buy it again without hesitation.

  How to Sharpen a Knife: How to use the Lansky Sharpening System + Review
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnHw0JBMcvU" target="_blank">LeesRandomVids youtube</a>
</h2>

In this video I'm showing how to use the Lansky Sharpening System plus
a quick overall review.

I show the differences in the Standard, the Deluxe, the Diamond and the
Diamond Deluxe versions of this Lansky Sharpening System and show you
how to set up and use the kit to sharpen a knife from completely blunt
to razor sharp without even stropping. The Lansky sharpener doesn't
come with a strop whichever kit you decide to buy, be it the standard
or deluxe, the normal or the diamond but you can sharpen your knives to
razor sharp without so I show without. Lansky also sell a strop for this
sharpening kit but I showed without.. plus I don't have one.

For this video I sharpen a kitchen knife that was completely blunt
using the standard 5 stone deluxe kit, for my next Lansky tutorial I
will sharpen a knife using my Lansky diamond sharpening kit.

  BEST Stropping Compound(For me) - Handamerican 0.5 micron diamond spray
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-Ds0ryZVf4" target="_blank">bigbubba5037 youtube</a>
</h3>

This is Handamerican 0.5 Micron Diamond Spray. Really excellent stuff. It
is very aggressive in the sense that it doesn't take many passes to get
results and it puts on a superb mirror polish. The final result is an
edge that has tons of bite and will still push cut and draw slice. HIGHLY
RECOMMENDED!

Use our 120 grit silicon carbide water stones for coarse sharpening
and removing large amounts of metal quickly. Un-mounted stones must be
mounted to a "stone blank" (sold separately) to be utilized with the
Edge Pro sharpening systems. Customers who go through many stones can
remove their worn out stones from the existing stone blank and mount
their un-mounted stones themselves saving 50% off the mounted stone
price. We suggest mounting the stones using 3M's Super 77 adhesive spray.
