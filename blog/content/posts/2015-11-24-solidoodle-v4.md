## Software - slicing and printing

Skeinforge is a popular piece of software for slicing a STL object into
GCode, which in turn tells the the 3D Printer what steps to take to
re-create your 3D object.

The official Solidoodle website provides a pre-configured Skeinforge
package, which will allow you to slice models using proper Solidoodle
settings right out of the box.

Pronterface is a software package that sends GCode and controls your
3D printer.

It is included in the Official Solidoodle software package.

# Filastruder hot end

## E3D v6 Hotend

$80 - All-metal E3D (v6) Hotend - 12 Volt / 1.75mm Universal w/Bowden Extras

<a href="http://www.filastruder.com/products/all-metal-e3d-v6-hotend" target="_blank">$74.99 - All-metal E3D (v6) Hotend</a>

With no PEEK or PTFE in hot regions of our HotEnd you can reach 300C
with the supplied thermistor. By swapping a thermistor for a thermocouple
(may require additional electronics) you can reach over 400C.

This not only allows you to print extremely high temperature materials
like Polycarbonate and Nylons but also eliminates HotEnd meltdown
failures associated with PEEK/PTFE designs. Although the latest v6
hotend has a PTFE liner inside the hotend this liner is never subjected
to high temperatures so there is no risk of damaging the liner through
overheating.

The new HeaterBlock gives the fastest heat up times and the most
responsive temperature control by clamping around the cartridge for
maximum thermal contact. The new thermistor placement means you get the
most accurate temperature readings with the fastest response. What this
means for you the user is that you can go from 20C to 200C in just 65
seconds, temperature control is responsive enough that you can keep the
hotend within 0.5C of your set temperature or less with ease.

I do love my E3D, no more heat creep ruining my prints and with the
shorter overall assembly I went from 100mm to 125mm in the Z axis. It
was pricey but I am definitely happy and would recommend it. The only
issue I have had with it is clogging (with PLA), I followed this method
and I haven't had any more issues. I have had successful 20+ hour prints.

By burning vegetable oil on the metal, you'll be creating a slippery,
very thin, heat resistant polymer coating that makes it very much easier
to remove the filament in the future.

### TPE

* EXTRUDER TEMP: 210-225 ° C
* Bed TEMP: 20-55 ° C
* BED ADHESION: Blue Painters Tape

TPE filament is a flexible 3D printing material that feels and acts much
like flexible rubber. TPE filament can be used to make parts that can
bend or must flex to fit their environment - stoppers, belts, springs,
phone cases and more. This extremely flexible 3D printer material will
allow you to create 3D prints that will have the properties of a soft
rubber, making it even more flexible and elastic than our Soft PLA
filament. TPE 3D printing filament is available in 1.75mm and 3mm.
