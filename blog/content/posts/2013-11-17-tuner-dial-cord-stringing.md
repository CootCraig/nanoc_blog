If there is a Michael's craft store in your area pick up some #6 bead
stringing cord it makes a perfect dial cord replacement.

when I get the stringing diagram and get it all together I'll let
ywall know the results.  It's not just 'hobbyshop' string. It's used
for stringing beads and is VERY strong and I'm sure will work great. I
may beezwax it first to be sure it's 'stiky' around the tunning shaft
and pullys just so's it won't slip..

the 1st bead string didn't work out too well so got some more, waxed and
abit thicker from a craft store, after hitting an old electronics parts
store that no longer gets dial cord, the GC brand. The waxed stuff was
easier to work with and I got it all strung and it works fine.
