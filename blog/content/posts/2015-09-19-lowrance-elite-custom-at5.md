#### [reefmaster forum](http://reefmaster.com.au/index.php/forum/support/720-elite-5-map-question#5389) Elite 5 map question - wishin i was fishin

I have a friend i am trying to set a map for, He has an Elite 5.

My map has isobaths and custom Polygons, I also have a satellite map
loaded on the same card. The issue i have is the custom Polygons not
displaying.

when the satellite map displays the custom Polygons disappear when the
unit is set on shaded relief. when on 2D the sat map is hidden and the
custom Polygons appear.

Has anyone come across this?
