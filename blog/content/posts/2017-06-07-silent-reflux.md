  GERD - Gastroesophageal reflux disease
</h3>

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), also known as acid reflux, is a
long-term condition where stomach contents come back up into the esophagus
resulting in either symptoms or complications.Symptoms include the taste
of acid in the back of the mouth, heartburn, bad breath, chest pain,
vomiting, breathing problems, and wearing away of the teeth. Complications
include esophagitis, esophageal strictures, and Barrett's esophagus.

</h3>

<h4>1. Raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar</h4>

As mentioned earlier, acid reflux typically results from having too
little acid in your stomach.

You can easily improve the acid content of your stomach by taking
one tablespoon of raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar in a large glass
of water.

<h4>2. Betaine</h4>
	
Another option is to take a betaine hydrochloric supplement, which is
available in health food stores without prescription. You'll want to
take as many as you need to get the slightest burning sensation and then
decrease by one capsule. This will help your body to better digest your
food, and will also help kill the H. pylori bacteria.

<h4>3. Baking soda</h4>

One-half to one full teaspoon of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) in an
eight-ounce glass of water may ease the burn of acid reflux as it helps
neutralize stomach acid. I would not recommend this as a regular solution
but it can sure help in an emergency when you are in excruciating pain.

<h4>4. Aloe juice</h4>

The juice of the aloe plant naturally helps reduce inflammation, which
may ease symptoms of acid reflux. Drink about 1/2 cup of aloe vera juice
before meals. If you want to avoid its laxative effect, look for a brand
that has removed the laxative component.

<h4>5. Ginger root or chamomile tea</h4>

Ginger has been found to have a gastroprotective effect by blocking acid
and suppressing helicobacter pylori.9 According to a 2007 study,10 it's
also far superior to lansoprazole for preventing the formation of ulcers,
exhibiting six- to eight-fold greater potency over the drug! This is
perhaps not all that surprising, considering the fact that ginger root has
been traditionally used against gastric disturbances since ancient times.

Add two or three slices of fresh ginger root to two cups of hot
water. Let steep for about half an hour. Drink about 20 minutes or so
before your meal.

Before bed, try a cup of chamomile tea, which can help soothe stomach
inflammation and help you sleep.

<h4>6. Vitamin D</h4>

Vitamin D is important for addressing any infectious component. Once
your vitamin D levels are optimized, you're also going to optimize your
production of about 200 antimicrobial peptides that will help your body
eradicate any infection that shouldn't be there.

As I've discussed in many previous articles, you can increase your vitamin
D levels through appropriate amounts of sun exposure, or through the
use of a safe tanning bed. If neither of those are available, you can
take an oral vitamin D3 supplement; just remember to also increase your
vitamin K2 intake.

<h4>7. Astaxanthin</h4>

This exceptionally potent antioxidant was found to reduce symptoms of
acid reflux in patients when compared to a placebo, particularly in
those with pronounced helicobacter pylori infection.11 Best results were
obtained at a daily dose of 40 mg.

<h4>8. Slippery elm</h4>

Slippery elm coats and soothes the mouth, throat, stomach,
and intestines, and contains antioxidants that can help address
inflammatory bowel conditions. It also stimulates nerve endings in
your gastrointestinal tract. This helps increase mucus secretion,
which protects your gastrointestinal tract against ulcers and excess
acidity. The University of Maryland Medical Center12 makes the following
adult dosing recommendations:

<pre>
Tea: Pour 2 cups boiling water over 4 g (roughly 2 tablespoons) of powdered bark, then steep for 3 - 5 minutes. Drink 3 times per day.
Tincture: 5 mL 3 times per day.
Capsules: 400 - 500 mg 3 - 4 times daily for 4 - 8 weeks. Take with a full glass of water.
Lozenges: follow dosing instructions on label.
</pre>

<h4>9. Chinese herbs for the treatment of "Gu" symptoms caused by chronic inflammatory diseases</h4>

So-called "Gu" symptoms include digestive issues associated with
inflammation and pathogenic infestation. For more information about
classical herbs used in Chinese Medicine for the treatment of such
symptoms, please see the article, "Treating Chronic Inflammatory Diseases
with Chinese Herbs: 'Gu Syndrome' in Modern Clinical Practice," published
by the Pacific College of Oriental Medicine

<h4>10. Glutamine</h4>

Research published in 2009 found that gastrointestinal damage caused by
H. pylori can be addressed with the amino acid glutamine, found in many
foods, including beef, chicken, fish, eggs, dairy products, and some
fruits and vegetables. L-glutamine, the biologically active isomer of
glutamine, is also widely available as a supplement.

<h4>11. Folate or folic acid (vitamin B9) and other B vitamins</h4>

As reported by clinical nutritionist Byron Richards,15 research suggests
B vitamins can reduce your risk for acid reflux. Higher folic acid
intake was found to reduce acid reflux by approximately 40 percent. Low
vitamin B2 and B6 levels were also linked to an increased risk for acid
reflux. The best way to raise your folate levels is by eating folate-rich
whole foods, such as liver, asparagus, spinach, okra, and beans.

Treating Chronic Inflammatory Diseases with Chinese Herbs: “Gu Syndrome” in Modern Clinical Practice by Heiner Fruehauf

<h4>What Causes Heartburn?</h4>

After food passes through your esophagus into your stomach, a muscular
valve called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) closes, preventing
food or acid to move back up.

Acid reflux occurs when the LES relaxes inappropriately, allowing acid
from your stomach to flow (reflux) backward into your esophagus. But
it's important to understand that acid reflux is not a disease caused
by excessive acid production in your stomach; rather it's a symptom more
commonly related to:

<ul>
  <li>Hiatal hernia1</li>
  <li>Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection (H. pylori bacteria is thought to affect more than half of the world's population, and has been identified as a Group 1 carcinogen by the World Health Organization2)</li>
</ul>

While these two conditions are unrelated, many who have a hiatal hernia
also have H. pylori, which cause a chronic low-level inflammation of your
stomach lining that can result in an ulcer3 and associated symptoms. If
you have a hiatal hernia, physical therapy on the area may work and many
chiropractors are skilled in this adjustment.

The hypothesis that H. pylori infection is responsible, or at least a
major factor, for producing the symptoms of acid reflux stems from the
work done by Dr. Barry Marshall, an Australian physician, during the
early 1980s.
