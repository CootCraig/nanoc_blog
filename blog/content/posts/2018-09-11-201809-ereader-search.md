You mentioned you preferred Android but thought I'd point out that your budget allows for an iPad.

iPad 6th gen (2018) $329
Apple Pencil $ 99
Logitech K380 Bluetooth Keyboard $20-30

Total: $450-460 before taxes, case and apps

Yes, the Apple Pencil is pricey but it's one of the nicer ones I've used.

I have a Kobo, but only buy from Amazon. I convert those books to ePub
in Calibre, then use Kobo Extended to convert those ePubs to kepubs when
I send them to my reader. With all that converting, I've never noticed
any conversion issues (the bulk of my reading is fiction, so maybe the
typically simple formatting helps).

No. I mostly buy eBooks from Amazon and, when I want to read on one
of the other (ePub) eReaders (I have too many), I just convert to ePub
from AZW3. Usually it gives me a chance to improve on the layout. AZW3
to ePub almost always goes smoothly. As a matter of fact, if I've still
got .mobi books that I want to convert to ePub, I find it usually helps
to convert them to AZW3 first, then convert them to ePub. I've run into
that a couple times with KePub books also. When the chapter is broken
up by graphic art images, I find that a KePub converted to directly
ePub when moving to the library (in Calibre) will sometimes truncate
a few lines before the graphic (when moved to eReaders, not in Calibre
itself). Converting to AZW3 then back to ePub gets rid of the graphic
(still leaves the extra spaces break) and doesn't truncate the text. (This
may be something I'm doing wrong.)

At any rate, I don't think you'll have any problems. Moving from AZW3 to
ePub has always been successful for me. I like to embed my favorite font
(now Deja Vu Serif E-Ink) and set the line spacing to 135%. The margins I
use for 6" readers are top 5, left and right, 9 and bottom, 1. For my 5"
readers left and right margins are changed to 7 instead.

I have 900+ in Kindle from Amazon Store over the years and I'm getting
very close to stopping my shopping there.

Currently I use Epubor to crack them and convert to EPUB Upload that
into Calibre for management and use #myshelves to setup collections on
a Kobo Aura One, Kobo H2O and setup Collections using Calibre Companion
on my Boox Note 10.3 that I just got.

Keep and deploy everything in epub to the devices and it works
wonderfully.

That Kobo Store is REALLY tempting me after see Amazon banning multiple
books today.
