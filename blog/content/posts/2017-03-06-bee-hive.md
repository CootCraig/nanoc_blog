Colorado native bees include mason bees, leaf cutter bees, sweat bees,
squash bees, bumble bees, and are some of natures best pollinators. They
are found through out North America and the front range of Colorado. Leaf
cutter bees are used by farmers to pollinate alfalfa fields. Mason bees
are used in orchards for pollination services. These bees are also in
decline as well and providing habitat is as simple as drilling 5/16"
holes in old logs or lumber.
