dang it gold’s supposed to go up! (report 4 december, 2016)

The Treasury bond is payabl only in US dollars. The US dollar, which is
the liability of the Federal Reserve, is backed on by Treasurys. It’s
a nice little check-kiting scheme. But besides that, the two instruments
have the same risks. If you don’t like the bond, then you won’t like
the dollar either. The day will come when en masse, the market decides it
doesn’t like both of them, and gold will be the only acceptable money.

With due respect to our old friend Aragorn, today is not that day!

We believe interest rates are headed lower, not higher. But that said,
we do not see any particular causal relationship between the interest
rate and the price of gold. The former is the spread between the Fed’s
undefined asset and its undefined liability. It is unhinged and while
it could shoot the moon from Truman through Carter, it’s sailing in
the other direction now. Down to Hell.

The price of gold is the exchange rate between the Fed’s liability and
metal. So long as people strive to get more dollars—most especially
including those who bet on the price of gold, and those who write letters
encouraging the bettors—there is no reason for this exchange rate
to explode.

Again, to plagiarize the Ranger from the North, the day will come when
gold goes into permanent backwardation. But today is not that day!

Today (Friday’s close), the price of gold is down seven Federal Reserve
Notes from where it was a week ago.

So where to from here? Are those dratted fundamentals moving?
