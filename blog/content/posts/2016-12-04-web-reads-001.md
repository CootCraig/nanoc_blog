dang it gold’s supposed to go up! (report 4 december, 2016)
Monetary Metals's picture
by Monetary Metals 

The Treasury bond is payabl only in US dollars. The US dollar, which is
the liability of the Federal Reserve, is backed on by Treasurys. It’s
a nice little check-kiting scheme. But besides that, the two instruments
have the same risks. If you don’t like the bond, then you won’t like
the dollar either. The day will come when en masse, the market decides it
doesn’t like both of them, and gold will be the only acceptable money.

With due respect to our old friend Aragorn, today is not that day!

We believe interest rates are headed lower, not higher. But that said,
we do not see any particular causal relationship between the interest
rate and the price of gold. The former is the spread between the Fed’s
undefined asset and its undefined liability. It is unhinged and while
it could shoot the moon from Truman through Carter, it’s sailing in
the other direction now. Down to Hell.

The price of gold is the exchange rate between the Fed’s liability and
metal. So long as people strive to get more dollars—most especially
including those who bet on the price of gold, and those who write letters
encouraging the bettors—there is no reason for this exchange rate
to explode.

Again, to plagiarize the Ranger from the North, the day will come when
gold goes into permanent backwardation. But today is not that day!

Today (Friday’s close), the price of gold is down seven Federal Reserve
Notes from where it was a week ago.

So where to from here? Are those dratted fundamentals moving?

Hi Tim,

If I remember correctly, Thorsten and others were recommending
attaching foam to the back of the wizzers on pro speakers like the
Eminence. Actually, I have a few full range and WR vintage speakers,
including Norelco (Philips), Chrysler, Mitsubishi (Diatone) and
others. They did not get much respect here, particularly the Japanese
stuff, so I usually only paid a few dollars for them. While not the
P-610 that everyone wants, it is extremely similar and also is Alnico
Magnet. It sounds quite good with its matching cone tweeter in an
extremely thin, crappy looking cabinet. These Japanese speakers still
show up in thrift stores for cheap, because the primarily came with
cheap, all-in-one stereo's that have long since died. A lot of them are
in Radio Shack and Lafayette cabinets, that were paired with inexpensive
electronics. You can also find them in Kenwood (Trio), Pioneer, Sansui,
and others cabinets. On this side of the pond, it would be wise for a
budget minded audiophile to take your advice, and go searching there
thrift stores. It won't cost much every if you get burned a few times.

The other thing that is still readily available cheap in thrift stores are
subwoofer from home theater systems. All you need is a tweeter. The Foster
FT17 is capable of the job. There is also lots of good vintage stuff.

  Party Like It’s 1999: The Stock Market Is A Propaganda Tool - Dave Kranzler
</h4>

December 8, 2016 

Dave Kranzler spent many years working in various Wall Street jobs. After
business school, he traded junk bonds for a large bank. He has an MBA from
the University of Chicago, with a concentration in accounting and finance,
and graduated Oberlin College with majors in Economics and English. Dave
has nearly thirty years of experience in studying, researching, analyzing
and investing in the financial markets. Currently he co-manages a precious
metals and mining stock investment fund in Denver and publishes the Mining
Stock and Short Seller Journals. Contact Dave at dkranzler62@gmail.com.

Thus, pushing the stock market a lot higher is a mechanism that can be
used to influence the public’s sentiment and willingness to spend. This
is critical after an election in which the political party controlling
Capitol Hill changes and – more important – during the holiday
shopping season.

Without question the U.S. economy is beginning to quickly crumble. If
you “peel away” the manipulative techniques applied to the
economic reporting it reveals that every segment of the economy is
now contracting. Even the factory orders report for October released
yesterday – which showed a 2.7% gain over September – is still down
2.3% YTD vs the same YTD period in 2015. Strip away the transportation
component and it’s down 2.7%.

Market intervention in this manner is an attempt to convince the public
that the economic system is healthy and will be even healthier in the
future. As such it’s another subtle propaganda tool – a perception
management device. If the Fed were step away from the market, the stock
market would rapidly re-price to reflect the true underlying economic
reality. In short, stocks would crash and concomitantly gold and silver
would soar.

The ONLY thing that can explain the move in the stock market since around
2:00 a.m. EST after the election is massive Fed stimulus in some form
– either direct cash injections done in a format that won’t show up
on the Fed’s balance sheet or a massive spike up in the availability
of short term credit lines made available to banks and extended to hedge
funds. There is no other explanation.

Today for example, the stock market is spiking higher AND bond prices
are higher/yields lower. This makes absolutely no sense and can only be
explained by official intervention of some sort.

Gold and silver will “sniff” this out and at some point I expect
to see gold begin to move a lot higher and the dollar sell-off
precipitously. I also expect that the Chinese are going to send their
response to Trump’s inimical overtures on Twitter by accelerating
their sale of U.S. Treasuries.

This will not end well.

Understanding Evil: From Globalism To Pizzagate
Thursday, 08 December 2016 07:05 - Brandon Smith -
H/T ZeroHedge

... The first and most important thing to understand is this — evil is
NOT simply a social or religious construct, it is an inherent element of
the human psyche. Carl Gustav Jung was one of the few psychologists in
history to dare write extensively on the issue of evil from a scientific
perspective as well as a metaphysical perspective.  I highly recommend
a book of his collected works on this subject titled 'Jung On Evil',
edited by Murray Stein, for those who are interested in a deeper view.

... The concepts of good and evil, moral and immoral, are present in us from
birth and are mostly the same regardless of where we are born, what time
in history we are born and to what culture we are born. Good and evil
are shared subjective experiences.  It is this observable psychological
fact (among others) that leads me to believe in the idea of a creative
design — a god.  Again, though, elaborating on god is beyond the scope
of this article.

  Cash Is No Longer King: The Phasing Out of Physical Money Has Begun
</h4>

If you want a glimpse of  how this story ends, all you have to do is look
at Venezuela, where the government has destroyed the value of the bolivar
(and U.S. intervention has further exacerbated the problem). Desperation
has overcome the country, leading women to go as far as selling their
own hair just to get by. While crime and murder rates have spiked
to all-time highs, the most dangerous threat to Venezuelans has been
extensive government planning. The money they work for and save is now
so valueless it’s weighed instead of counted. The stacks of bills have
to be carried around in backpacks, and the scene is reminiscent of the
hyperinflation Weimar Germany experienced in the 1920s. Few Western
nations have ever experienced a currency crisis before, meaning many
are blind to the inevitable consequences that come from the unending
stimulus we’ve seen since 2008.

In order to keep this kind of chaos from spreading like a contagion
to the rest of the world, representatives are willing to do anything
necessary, but this comes at a cost. Instead of having to worry about
carrying around wheelbarrows full of money, the fear in a cashless
society will likely stem from bank customers’ restricted access to
funds. With no physical way for consumers to take possession of their
wealth, the banking interests will decide how much is available.

The level of trust most people still have in the current system
is astonishing. Even after decades of incompetence, manipulation,
and irresponsibility, the public still grasps to government and the
established order like a child learning how to swim. The responsibility
that comes with independence has intimidated the entire population into
leaving the decisions up to so-called  ‘experts.’ It just so happens
that those trusted policymakers have an agenda to strip you and future
generations of prosperity.

Some of the few hopes in this war against centralization are peer-to-peer
technologies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These innovative platforms have
the potential to open up markets that circumvent state-controlled Ponzi
schemes. The future development of crypto-assets has massive potential,
but being co-opted is a real danger.

The greatest threat to individual freedom is financial dependence, and
as long as your wealth is under someone else’s control, it can never
be completely secure. Unfortunately, private blockchains are becoming
increasingly popular, creating trojan horses for those just learning about
the technology (in contrast, Bitcoin’s transaction ledger is public)
. Without the decentralized aspect of a financial network, it is just
a giant tracking database that can be easily compromised like any other.

  Fed Raised Rates 0.25% – Rising Rates Positive For Gold by GoldCore 
</h4>

From a long term investor, pension owner and physical buyers perspective,
it is prudent to ignore the noise and focus on the fact that the Fed's
monetary policies, along with most central banks in the world, remains
extremely accommodating.

The market perception and narrative is that a rise in rates, even by a
marginal 75 basis points will be negative for gold in 2017. This may
be true in the short term as perception, even misguided perception,
can drive markets in the short term.

However, rising interest rates per se are not negative for gold. What
is negative is positive real interest rates and yields above the rate
of inflation. This is unlikely to be seen any time soon.

The data and the historical record shows that rising interest rates are
actually positive for gold. The most recent example we have of rising
interest rates is when the Fed increased interest rates in the 2003 to
2006 period (see table above and research note here). As can be seen in
the table above, in June 2003, the Fed funds rate was at 1% and by June
2006, it had been increased to over 5.5%.

Even if the Fed increases rates, interest rates remain close to zero
not just in the U.S but in most major economies. Thus, there is no
opportunity cost to owning the non yielding gold. Indeed there remains
significant counterparty and systemic risk in keeping one’s savings in
a bank and government bonds look like a bubble that is being supported
by money printing and debt monetisation.

This period of ultra-loose monetary policies needs to come to end as
soon as possible as debt levels are surging globally creating the real
risk of a new debt crisis in 2017.

Gold is looking shaky in the short term and the technicals and momentum
is on the side of the bears. This could push gold lower into year end,
back to test support at $1,100/oz.

Today, after a near 50% correction in recent years, gold again has
significant potential for substantial capital gains in 2017 and during
the Trump Presidency.

For investors looking to diversify and hedge the significant risks facing
us in 2017, gold is again at a very attractive entry point.

Review of P-38 Can Opener and P-51 Can Opener

Mine is from 1944. It's been on my key ring for many years. There are no
sharp edge remaining on the outside and it's worn smooth. I don't know
what they made these things of, but it still works perfect. Once you learn
how to use one, you never forget, and it only takes about twice the time
to open a can with one of these as a hand crank opener. For those whiners
that can't figure out how to use it or it hurts their fingers, I have a
little piece of advice for you, sign up with your local recruiter. As a
civilian, about the last thing you will use this thing for is opening a
can. You use for prying open battery compartments to replace batteries,
cutting tape on boxes, cutting string, as a flat blade screw driver or use
a corner as a Phillips head, and scratching the corrosion off something.

This Christmas I decided to surprise my 27-year-old son and not ask him what he wanted for Christmas. I made him up a key chain like mine made up of:


<ul>
  <li>This P38 (had to drill the hole slightly larger to fit over the Lucky Line 81101 Key Ring)</li>
  <li>Stanley 39-130 3 x 1/4-Inch PowerLock Key Tape (used all the time when I'm buying stuff in the store)</li>
  <li>Leatherman 831189 Squirt PS4 (pliers is great, the scissors and knife are Exacto-blade-sharp, and the airlines will steal it from you)</li>
  <li>Kingston DTSE9H/8GBZET Flash drive (Very useful when you need to bring back a copy of something, or give someone else a copy. It's smaller than any key, one-piece metal, no ridiculous cap to lose, and you won't drive off and leave it stuck in a computer somewhere because your car keys are with it.)</li>
  <li>Kikkerland Camera Magnifier with LED Light (MG43) (when you're working something in a dark area trying to read half-worn-off model numbers or finding something you dropped outside at night. It uses replaceable CR927 batteries that haven't ever had to be replaced, and best of all, SMALL. With chain and all, it is no longer than my car key.)</li>
  <li>Lucky Line 81101 Key Ring to tie it all together (The 81101 cable key ring doesn't unlock when you don't want it to. However, in addition to the movie, it required some practice on my part to get the hang of locking and unlocking it.)</li>
</ul>

The cable key ring beats the stars out of rigid key rings because a
flexible cable enables everything to lay flat in your pocket, so it
doesn't poke you when you squat down, or shred your pocket when you pull
it out. The only thing on it with any significant weight, is the tiny
version of the Leatherman. This combo has saved me untold time time being
able to fix things on the spot without having to stop to fetch tools,
slice open boxes, after maneuvering into a dark cramped area being able
to read half worn away serial numbers, and being able to measure things
in the store to make sure that I return with the correct size.

That's about a $40 key chain, and you can never know how Christmas
surprises will go over. Well, I hit it out of the park this time. I also
learned something along the way. The new P38 looks exactly the same as
mine, but they don't work exactly the same. On both his P38 and P51, the
blade snaps shut. Mine flops back and forth. I remembered that mine was
that way when it was new. Even though I like the smooth worn condition of
the one I have, and my worn one has never caused me a problem, I ordered
a new one.

Now I have another problem. Others want one like we have, and I'm
ordering again, so I decided to document it here in case someone else
likes the combination.

  The One Thing Doug Casey Is Very Confident Of: “We’re Going To Have Financial Chaos… It’s A Dangerous Situation”
  Mac Slavo - December 19th, 2016
</h4>

With Donald Trump set to take office in late January 2017, Casey believes
his infrastructure initiatives will be a boon for the commodities
industry:

<blockquote>
I really believe him. I think that they’re going to push for doing lots of infrastructure in the U.S. and that’s going to take a lot of metals, so that’s a favorable short-term influence for metals… I can be talked into buying a copper or zinc or cobalt stock, but I want to stick with gold… and also uranium… I really think that the future of power generation is going to be in solar related things…. but at the present moment, by far the cheapest, the cleanest and the safest form of mass power generation is still nuclear… that’s exactly the opposite of what everybody is told… but especially if we have a de-regulated environment in the future, nuclear is going to do well… There are about 150 new nuclear plants under construction around the world… most of them in China and India… I’m very bullish on uranium… it’s selling below the cost of production.

  Is The Auto Industry Slowdown Signaling Trouble Ahead For The Overall Economy - Tyler Durden's picture
</h4>

Goldman's David Tamberrino recently downgraded the U.S. auto industry

<blockquote>
<p><strong>We lower our Autos and Auto Parts coverage view to Cautious from Neutral. </strong>As we progress through the later stages of the US auto cycle, we expect a sales plateau through 2017 held up by increasing OEM incentives. Beyond this, we see US light vehicle sales mean reverting back toward normalized SAAR of 15mn from 2018 through 2020 as pent-up demand clears through. In addition, as we dissect some of the drivers of the later stage growth, we expect the non-recurrence of several tailwinds (higher leasing penetration, higher non- and sub- prime FICO score penetration) in addition to macroeconomic factors (rising interest rates and crude oil prices) to be headwinds to further growth and the favorable pricing environment for both OEMs and suppliers. </p>

<h5>Collateral as Trust</h5>

Without collateral there is no trust, and without trust there is no
credit, and without credit there is no leverage. And I’m not talking
speculative “bet it all on black, sell the schleps another MBS”
leverage.

I’m talking leverage of resources. I’ve got a lawnmower, let me mow
your lawn, and you’re pretty good at math, so how about you teach my
kids some math. That is leverage in its most basic form. It begins with
leveraging talent, time, and resources. Africa suffers from many things
but a fundamentally and tragically poor system of trust sits at the top
and the consequences are that collateral is not created.

In my last article, I outlined the deliberately engineered trend toward
the forced “harmonization” of national economies and monetary
policies, as well as the ultimate end goal of globalists: a single world
currency system controlled by the International Monetary Fund and, by
extension, global governance, which internationalists sometimes refer
to in their more honest public moments as the “new world order.”

  A reminder of the great wealth transfer underway

<h5>The Math</h5>

As a thought experiment, let's explore the math a little bit to see
where it leads us. After all, I did just say that a poor end to all of
this is a "mathematical certainty," so let's test that theory a bit. I
think you'll find this both interesting and useful.

To begin, Total Credit Market Debt (TCMD) is a measure of all the various
forms of debt in the U.S. That includes corporate, state, federal, and
household borrowing.  So student loans are in there, as are auto loans,
mortgages, and municipal and federal debt. It's pretty much everything
debt-related.

What it does not include, though, are any unfunded obligations,
entitlements, or other types of liabilities. So the Social Security
shortfalls are not in there, nor are the underfunded pensions at the
state or corporate levels. TCMD is just debt, plain and simple.

As you can see in this next chart, since 1970, TCMD has been growing
exponentially and almost perfectly, too. (The R2 is over 0.99, for you
science types):
