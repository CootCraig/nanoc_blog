Keyed to Strong's Exhaustive Concordance and the only complete interlinear
Bible available in English, this four-volume Interlinear Bible offers
pastors, students, and laypeople a time-saving tool for researching
the subtle nuances and layers of meaning within the original biblical
languages. Featuring the complete Hebrew and Greek texts with a direct
English rendering below each word, it also it also includes The Literal
Translation of the Bible in the outside column. Strong's numbers are
printed directly above the Hebrew and Greek words which enables those
with no prior knowledge of Greek or Hebrew to easily access a wealth of
language reference works keyed to Strong's Greek/Hebrew dictionaries,
analytical lexicons, concordances, word studies and more.

The Hebrew is based on the Masoretic Text and the Greek is from the
Textus Receptus. The sources of the texts are documented in the preface,
and are essentially the same (with some minor variations) to the Hebrew
and Greek texts used by the KJV translators.

This four-volume Interlinear Bible contains 7-point text.

</h2>

<h4>Jesus Christ said He is "the way" to the Father.</h4>

"Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me'" (John 14:6).

<h4>"The way" God has called us to is challenging. It is not just a hobby, but a total way of life.</h4>

"Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it" (Matthew 7:14).

<h4>"The Way" became a title for followers of Jesus—the name of their belief before the term "Christian" was used.</h4>

"And asked letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, so that if he
found any who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them
bound to Jerusalem" (Acts 9:2; see Acts 11:26 for the first reference
to Christians).

The Nelson Study Bible says, "Originally, the church called themselves
'The Way.' But later they began to refer to themselves as Christians,
despite the fact that the name most likely was originally used to ridicule
the believers."
