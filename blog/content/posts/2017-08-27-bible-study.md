Keyed to Strong's Exhaustive Concordance and the only complete interlinear
Bible available in English, this four-volume Interlinear Bible offers
pastors, students, and laypeople a time-saving tool for researching
the subtle nuances and layers of meaning within the original biblical
languages. Featuring the complete Hebrew and Greek texts with a direct
English rendering below each word, it also it also includes The Literal
Translation of the Bible in the outside column. Strong's numbers are
printed directly above the Hebrew and Greek words which enables those
with no prior knowledge of Greek or Hebrew to easily access a wealth of
language reference works keyed to Strong's Greek/Hebrew dictionaries,
analytical lexicons, concordances, word studies and more.

The Hebrew is based on the Masoretic Text and the Greek is from the
Textus Receptus. The sources of the texts are documented in the preface,
and are essentially the same (with some minor variations) to the Hebrew
and Greek texts used by the KJV translators.

This four-volume Interlinear Bible contains 7-point text.
