### What Does USB Do?

USB cables replace the huge variety of connectors that used to be standard
for computer peripherals: Parallel ports, DB9 Serial, keyboard and mouse
ports, joystick and midi ports... Really, it was getting out of hand. USB
simplifies the process of installing and replacing hardware by making all
communications adhere to a serial standard which takes place on a twisted
pair data cable and identifies the device that's connected. When you add
the power and ground connections, you're left with a simple 4-conductor
cable that's inexpensive to make and easy to stow.

### What Kinds of Cables are Out There?

99% of host controllers will have a USB-A receptacle, so when
you're looking for a USB cable, you'll usually be looking for a "USB
A-to-something" cable. A lot of the time the USB-A end is assumed, since
that's the connector on most PCs, and cables will be named after the
connector on the opposite end. Some smaller hosts use a Mini or Micro
receptacle but they usually supply a pigtail adapter to USB-A.
