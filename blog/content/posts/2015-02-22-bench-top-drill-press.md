# Motivation

I've been thinking
about what could be done with
a DIY benchtop drill on a custom
workstation stand.

#### [page](http://tips.woodmagazine.com/stands/this-benchtop-drill-press-acts-all-grown-up/) Tip from Gordon Schrader, Mufreesboro, TN

### The station by Gordon S. lit a spark

My first thought is to shorten the pipe stand
so the bit chuck is below the top
of a workstation box.

A system of securing objects can be build
into the box stand.
