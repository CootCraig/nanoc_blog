Inspired by

ImplicitCAD provides a Haskell API, so you can also design objects in Haskell.

# Install

Let's get started

Note: as of 8.0.1 there are two download options available â€” minimal
and full. The minimal option is currently the generally recommended
one. It does not include any additional global libraries beyond those
packaged with ghc, though it does include all tools. This ensures maximal
compatibility with a variety of library sets. The full option is useful
for those who prefer the "classic" platform behavior with a broader set
of preinstalled libraries, and especially serves those well who want
full-featured installers in situations where network connectivity should
not be taken for granted.

Note also: the stack tool has been evolving relatively rapidly. Users who
wish to ensure they are running the latest version may want to consider
running "stack update" and ensuring the proper path for stack-installed
binaries is in their environment.

### <a href="https://www.haskell.org/platform/#linux-generic" target="_blank">Generic Linux</a>

This is a generic distribution of the Haskell Platform. While it should
work on most modern Linux distributions, you may want to investigate
use one of the distribution-specific options listed on the right.

The latest version of the Haskell Platform for Linux is 8.0.1.

#### Install by running:

### Use Stack to get going with Haskell

Get Stack to get GHC installed and to build your projects.

If you don't know anything about Stack and would like an overview, check out this comprehensive

#### Also, DO NOT INSTALL HASKELL PLATFORM

Instead of following the instructions on Haskell.org, get Stack.
