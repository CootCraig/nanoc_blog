YakAttack HD Track Mount Mounting Plate


The YakAttack HD Track Mount Mounting Plate is a non-rotating solution
to mounting RAM balls to tracks. With a hole pattern that matches RAM's
diamond and round bases, you can also attach aluminum RAM balls for
heavy duty applications. An aluminum pin on the bottom of the YakAttack
HD Track Mount Mounting Plate keeps it from rotating while installed on
either YakAttack Gear Tracs or other factory installed tracks.

RAM RAM-101-LO11 RAM Mount Lowrance

The RAM-101-LO11 consists of a 2.5" diameter round base that contains
the universal AMPS hole pattern double socket arm and adapter base
that inserts directly to the back of Lowrance Elite-5 and Mark-5
Fishfinders. The adapter serves as a quick release mechanism, allowing
you to remove or transfer your Fishfinder in seconds. Designed into
the mount is a 1.5" diameter patented rubber ball and socket system
with adjustment points at both socket ends of the arm; this with RAM's
rubber ball and socket technology allows for almost infinite adjustment
and perfect viewing angles.

# NMEA

#### [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183) NMEA 0183

NMEA 0183 is a combined electrical and data specification for
communication between marine electronics such as echo sounder, sonars,
anemometer, gyrocompass, autopilot, GPS receivers and many other types of
instruments. It has been defined by, and is controlled by, the National
Marine Electronics Association. It replaces the earlier NMEA 0180 and
NMEA 0182 standards.[1] In marine applications, it is slowly being phased
out in favor of the newer NMEA 2000 standard.

The electrical standard that is used is EIA-422, although most
hardware with NMEA-0183 outputs are also able to drive a single EIA-232
port. Although the standard calls for isolated inputs and outputs, there
are various series of hardware that do not adhere to this requirement.

The NMEA 0183 standard uses a simple ASCII, serial communications protocol
that defines how data are transmitted in a "sentence" from one "talker" to
multiple "listeners" at a time. Through the use of intermediate expanders,
a talker can have a unidirectional conversation with a nearly unlimited
number of listeners, and using multiplexers, multiple sensors can talk
to a single computer port.

At the application layer, the standard also defines the contents of
each sentence (message) type, so that all listeners can parse messages
accurately.

Team Colibri -
With any of the Lowrance 83/200 ducers I would recommend 200 kHz fixed
frequenzy or Medium CHIRP. I have seen more or less NO increase in
resolution with HST-WSBL or 83/200/455/800-HDI in High CHIRP versus 200
kHz in depths less then 30 meters (90 feet). In Medium the results are
surprisingly good considering the price on these ducers.
