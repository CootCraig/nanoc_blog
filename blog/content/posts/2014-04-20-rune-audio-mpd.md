AT THE HEART OF YOUR DIGITAL HI-FI SYSTEM

A RuneAudio device places itself in the heart of a digital music system.

It’s a streamer player: it can reproduce your digital music library
from local USB drives or network mounts (NAS), and also plays any internet
stream (web radios).

It’s an headless player: it can be remotely controlled by multiple
clients running on different devices.

It’a a digital player, staying at the top of the audio signal flow
chain. It offers perfect and gapless playback of common audio formats,
and works best when connected to an asynchronous USB 2.0 DAC.
