I know this is down-beat stuff (sorry), but people really need to know
how criminal regulatory decision making has become. We used to use much,
much, much safer pressurized light water cooled and moderated thermal
reactors. Use of these plutonium producing sodium-cooled fast reactors
is way, way, way too dangerous for any vulnerable area on earth. We
need immediate international control of any and all significant reactor
meltdown risk situations; Japan has proved States will gamble (and lose)
Worldwide environmental health in the selfish hopes of saving some repair
costs. The present meltdown of all three cores was completely avoidable
! Those criminals gambled our children's health away to save Yen :

## Question

What are the good reactors in use now, if there are any?

## Response

Tim Rude I've learned that i have grown out of touch since my reactor
operator days (go figure), but i doubt there's any nuclear reactor type
that is safer than the pressurized light water cooled and moderated
thermal nuclear reactor (for several physics reasons). I'm sure those
much safer reactors are presently in use. Those reactors do not transmute
fertile material into more fuel however, and that's why they have gone
to the much, much, much more dangerous sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR)
type reactors (SFRs make valuable plutonium fuel as a byproduct). SFRs
should certainly never be located in vulnerable places. If they don't
have a very safe, sparsely populated, geologically stable, flood and
tsunami proof area, they should be required to use the much safer
pressurized light water cooled and moderated thermal nuclear reactors
(unless there's something better, which i doubt). I am amazed at the
stupidity building those SFRs at Fukushima. I am also amazed at the
stupidity of locating the emergency cooling pumps in a location where
they could be (and were) flooded and rendered inoperative by seawater;
kids can understand how stupid that is.
