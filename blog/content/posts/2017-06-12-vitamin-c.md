  Optimum Intake of Vitamin C by slimjohn
</h4>

Vitamin C.  If too little is ineffective (below RDA) and if high dosage
detrimental in long term, what is the optimal dosage?  At daily intakes
of 100mg or greater, cells are saturated; at daily intakes of 200-400mg,
plasma concentrations increase marginally.  Excess vitamin C that
not absorbed at higher single dosages (1g or greater) is excreted.
Multiple daily dosages (1g or greater total) though may result in
expensive pee and, worst, in greater potential for pro-oxidant vitamin
C and depletion of glutathione.

According to this article (below), the OPTIMAL level intake of vitamin
C to MAXIMIZE HEALTH BENEFITS and to MINIMIZE ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS is
200mg/day - enough to saturate your cells and maintain adequate plasma
concentration.  Vitamin C could then be taken in multiple dosages (e.g.,
100mg, 2x/day) or in single dose 200mg slow-release formulation.  I am
now taking Doctor's Best PureWay-C, 250mg/day.  I split the tablets but
that may not be good idea for sustained-release; probably should take
complete tablet (500mg sustained-release/day) which should be okay since
it's not full-release 500 mg but spread out over 12 hours.

Note: Are you taking ascorbic acid instead of vitamin C? Ascorbic acid
is not vitamin C. Ascorbic acid is synthetic vitamin C without essential
cofactors. When you take only ascorbic acid tablets, your body must
gather all of the other components of the full vitamin C complex from
your body’s tissues in order to make use of it. In the event that your
body does not have adequate reserves of the other components (e.g. rutin,
hesperidin, etc.), ascorbic acid itself does not provide any of the full
health benefits of vitamin C.

PureWay-C, used in Doctor's Best PureWay-C, is a clinically proven
and patent pending new form of vitamin C that contains vitamin C-lipid
metabolites and bioflavonoids.
