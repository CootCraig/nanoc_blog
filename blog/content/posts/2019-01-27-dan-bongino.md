Dan Bongino tackles the hot political issues, debunking both liberal
and Republican establishment rhetoric. A former Secret Service Agent,
NYPD veteran, and New York Times best-selling author, Bongino is best
known amongst conservatives for his willingness to take on the Left and
the Republican Establishment through his campaign for Congress, which
nearly resulted in a historic political upset in the liberal bastion
of Maryland. These experiences uniquely situate Dan to provide the best
commentary and analysis from not only a law enforcement viewpoint, but
also one that directly attacks the philosophical underpinnings of the
Left and Big Government Republicans.
