10’X10’ Portable “Modified” Gothic Hoophouse Here is a quick
easy gothic hoop design built using the EC ‐ 12 or DY ‐ 12 our Quick
Hoop Benders .  Produces a nice gothic hoop 10 feet wide with high peak
profile making it great for snow load areas of the country.  It can
also be built using either 1 3/8” fence top rail tubing or the less
expensive 1” emt tubing.  The two hoop sections result in a 145 degree
connection angle at the peak.  Fittings can be found on the internet
from several sources.  Here is a starter link to one fitting supplier.
Note, If using Our gothic base connectors you must start bending at
10” mark to achive a vertical connection to the connectors.

Mark two each pcs of 1”emt 10” inches from the end of each pipe with
any paint marker.  These ends will be the bottom of the gothic hoop.
Began bending 1” emt by sliding the 10” inches of the marked end of
the tube through the holding strap of the Model DY ‐ 12 or Model EC ‐
12 bender.  Proceed with bending, making sure each bending stroke stops
before reaching end of the bender, and insuring that the tubing remains
level with the bender on the output side of the bender...  For the last
bending stroke insert special lever bar and bend until junction of lever
bar/emt contact the bender body.  Remove tubing, repeat steps on second
emt tube.  Note, If using Our gothic base connectors you must start
bending at 10” mark to achive a vertical connection to the connectors.
Otherwise you can reduce the base width began the bending process at a
value less than 10” inches..  Or widen the base width began bending
at a value more than 10” inches .
