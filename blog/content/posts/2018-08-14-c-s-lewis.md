Of these books, The Screwtape Letters probably sold the best, but the
one that has lasted to this day—especially in terms of reputation
and stature—is his short but vigorous Abolition of Man. As with Mere
Christianity, published in 1952 but based on several of Lewis’s World
War II addresses, The Abolition of Man began as a series of lectures,
ostensibly to consider the state of the English language and the
teaching of it. Owen Barfield, one of Lewis’ closest friends and a
deeply important scholar in his own right, pronounced The Abolition of
Man not only Lewis’s best non-fiction work, but also the best example
of one of Lewis’s two best traits: his “atomic rationality.” (The
other trait was his romantic mythmaking.) Since its initial publication
seventy-five years ago, The Abolition of Man has served as one of the
finest non-reactionary bulwarks against the faddish ideologies and various
subjectivisms and other nihilistic nonsense of the political and cultural
Left. No student can read it without calling into question the whole of
his education.

  In What Order Should the Narnia Books Be Read?
</h4>

<h5>Publication Order</h5>

Below is the original order in which The Chronicles of Narnia first appeared on bookshelves:

1. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1950)
2. Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia (1951)
3. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (1952)
4. The Silver Chair (1953)
5. The Horse and His Boy (1954)
6. The Magician’s Nephew (1955)
7. The Last Battle (1956)

<h5>Chronological Order</h5>

Sometime after the death of C. S. Lewis, British editions of the books began appearing that were numbered chronologically:

1. The Magician’s Nephew
2. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe
3. The Horse and His Boy
4. Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia
5. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
6. The Silver Chair
7. The Last Battle

<h5>What did C. S. Lewis actually say?</h5>

One year after the final Narnia book was published, an 11-year-old boy
named Lawrence Krieg wrote to Lewis asking which order he should re-read
the books in (he had already read them once in publication order). His
mother felt he should stick with the original order, but Lawrence wondered
if he should re-read chronologically. The author’s response:

<q>
“I think I agree with your order for reading the books more than with your mother’s. The series was not planned beforehand as she thinks. When I wrote The Lion I did not know I was going to write any more. Then I wrote P. Caspian as a sequel and still didn’t think there would be any more, and when I had done The Voyage I felt quite sure it would be the last. But I found as I was wrong. So perhaps it does not matter very much in which order anyone read them.”
    – C. S. Lewis, 4/23/57
