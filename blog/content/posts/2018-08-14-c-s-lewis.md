Of these books, The Screwtape Letters probably sold the best, but the
one that has lasted to this day—especially in terms of reputation
and stature—is his short but vigorous Abolition of Man. As with Mere
Christianity, published in 1952 but based on several of Lewis’s World
War II addresses, The Abolition of Man began as a series of lectures,
ostensibly to consider the state of the English language and the
teaching of it. Owen Barfield, one of Lewis’ closest friends and a
deeply important scholar in his own right, pronounced The Abolition of
Man not only Lewis’s best non-fiction work, but also the best example
of one of Lewis’s two best traits: his “atomic rationality.” (The
other trait was his romantic mythmaking.) Since its initial publication
seventy-five years ago, The Abolition of Man has served as one of the
finest non-reactionary bulwarks against the faddish ideologies and various
subjectivisms and other nihilistic nonsense of the political and cultural
Left. No student can read it without calling into question the whole of
his education.
