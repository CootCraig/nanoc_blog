Even the 6L90 in the gasser 2500's is a pretty reliable trans.

After my first one - the learning experience one where it took me a lot more time and fiddling - I just get a combo kit from a seller on ebay called ctpowertrain. It is around $160 for the entire thing but it is worth it IMO. Just have to get the right year range kit from them. 4L60E code buster kit they call it or something like that.

Diesel ownership introduces a lot of potential expenses most especially
with repairs. And the Allison 1000 is no more bullet proof than a 4L80E
or a 6L90E behind their respective motors.

2007.5 was the first year for the 6L80E in the NNBS and only available behind the 6.2 in the Denali's.
In 2009 the 6L80E was standard in the Crew Cabs with the 5.3.
In 2010 the 6L80E was standard across all body styles with the 5.3.
2007.5-2013 with the 4.3 V6 and 4.8 V8, the 4L60E was the only option.
2007.5-2013 with the 6.2 V8, the 6L80E was the only option.
2013 was the last year for the 4L60E in the Silverado, which was behind a 4.3 V6 and 4.8 V8 only.h1>Silverado/Sierra 2500 - Second generation (2007–2014)

Sorry but diesels do not cost less to own, no matter how you slice it
up. I am experienced in the diesel world having owned cummins trucks
and driven, quite often, dmax's and powerstrokes.  I now tow a heavy
trailer with my 6.0. Guess why.  Its cool if you want it. Its your money
to spend as you wish. But to say its cheaper, or the cost is the same is
simply just trying to talk yourself into it.  It isn't cheaper in any way.

If cost weren't a factor, I assure you I wouldn't be driving a 6.0 gas.

The issue with transmissions most of the time is people forget to change
fluids at 70k miles on them. I've had transmission shops tell me the
same thing about the 4L60E. Mine went at 165k

... Then good info on diesel engines.

The 6.0 gasser is a workhorse and a powerhouse, you can tow a lot with
it, you will not have the power a duramax has never will come close. and
the MPGs 10-12 (on a good day) really suck but that's just the way
gassers are.

Gassers are cool to but don't make as much power and MPGs aren't the best. I've never ridden in a 6.0 gasser that's made over 10 mpgs.

Every truck has it's issues, it's all a matter of which ones you're
willing to deal with. Ram transmissions are 50 times worse than GM
transmissions, and I find Rams to be the lowest quality in terms of
USA trucks

GM 6.0 gassers don't have nearly as much issues as the diesels, and every
diesel is going to have issues based on emissions, Fordd, Dodge, or chevy
the DPF was designed to fail and clog and cost us consumers money. Ford
Superduty and GM HDs are the best in terms of reliable gas trucks.

Look at the trucks contractors use in your area to go from jobsite to
jobsite or even landscapers. I promise you'll barely see a ram, and if
you do it's a cummins. I wish you luck in your search.

A 2500 is way overkill for your needs. You could get a nicer and less miles 1500

Those two trucks with those miles just show you how far they go. And I
bet both those 6.0's run perfectly, have never had engine overhauls or
even injectors replaced.

The tow/haul mode is a life benefit to the trans. Quicker more crisp
shifts reduce slippage which reduces heat and wear on the trans.

It is more or less, a push button shift kit.

4L60E's are definitely what we call a weak trans, mechanically.

It all depends on how it was driven and maintained. Many folks barely
given the trans any attention at all, and it is a problem waiting to
happen. Some are meticulous about servicing the trans and not abusing it,
and there are many examples of the 6L90 going to well beyond 300K miles
without a problem.

I am somewhat goofy about this sort of thing. All of my drivetrain
components... trans, diffs, Xfer... all get fluid changes at roughly 10K
miles. Then ballpark 50K intervals after that. Even filter change at same
time on the trans. I have never had a drive train component failure in
45 years. Including living in the interior of Alaska for 10 years. And
all my vehicles have to deal with rural gravel roads and working off road
frequently. Many of these vehicles went beyond 200K with me. Either got
traded or scraped if they died of body cancer. But components were fine.
