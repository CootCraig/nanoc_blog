  Intermodal container
</h2>

An intermodal container is a large standardized shipping container,
designed and built for intermodal freight transport, meaning these
containers can be used across different modes of transport –
from ship to rail to truck – without unloading and reloading
their cargo. Intermodal containers are primarily used to store and
transport materials and products efficiently and securely in the global
containerized intermodal freight transport system, but smaller numbers
are in regional use as well. These containers are known under a number
of names, such as simply container, cargo or freight container, ISO
container, shipping, sea or ocean container, container van or (Conex)
box, sea or c can.

Intermodal containers exist in many types and a number of standardized
sizes, but ninety percent of the global container fleet are so-called
"dry freight" or "general purpose" containers, durable closed steel boxes,
mostly of either twenty or forty foot (6 or 12m) standard length. The
common heights are 8 feet 6 inches (2.6 m) and 9 feet 6 inches (2.9 m)
– the latter are known as High Cube or Hi-Cube containers.
