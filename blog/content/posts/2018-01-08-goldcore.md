  <li>Fundamentals do not justify the massive gains in US stocks in recent years (rise of over 300% in the S&P 500 since 2009)?</li>
  <li>Does the U.S. have a perfect 'Goldilocks economy' or a vulnerable 'Food stamp economy'?</li>
  <li>Are we in a ultra low interest rate, liquidity driven "everything bubble"?</li>

GoldCore CEO Stephen Flood and GoldCore's Research Director and precious
metals commentator Mark O'Byrne in discussion with Dave Russell.

And most importantly we discuss what investors can do to protect
themselves from the effects of the “Everything Bubble” bursting

Cutting through the financial markets jargon and looking at the risks
to your investment portfolio that aren't spoken about in the mainstream
media.
