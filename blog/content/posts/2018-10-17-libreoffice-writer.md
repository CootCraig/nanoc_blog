It occurred to me that perhaps I should clarify "inconsistent use of
styles" (save you having to delve into that other thread I linked). The
biggest surprise that most people hit when they export to HTML is that
their spacing or layout has gone awry. To avoid that the rule is pretty
simple:

All document whitespace and layout should be managed using styles -
not with the spacebar, return or tab keys.

Use your spacebar only to put a single space between words. Use your
return key only to start a new paragraph or heading. Do not use your
tab key.

Any time you think you want to hit the spacebar or return key more than
once (or a tab key even once) to insert extra space then know that you
are not using styles properly (are are likely to run into problems with
HTML export).

Use explicitly named styles for your part and chapter headings - typically
these would be level 1 and level 2 headings, respectively. Front matter
should not use heading level styles, just explicitly named paragraph
styles (to avoid having them accidentally show up in the TOC).

That is the objective. The only interesting part after that is learning
how to get the styles to do what you want.

Note: It's only difficult when you first start. Once you get a collection
of named styles that work as you want, you just use that as a template
for your new documents and keep writing.

There is a second rule: keep your formatting as simple as possible. The
more complex your format requirements the more difficulties you will
experience when you migrate between formats.

  ESSENTIAL LibreOffice Tutorials for Teachers by Bernard John Poole 
</h3>

These tutorials for LibreOffice 4.X are designed to help pre-service and
in-service teachers learn the suite of productivity applications included
in LibreOffice.  But teachers at all levels who need to improve their
skills in any of the LibreOffice applications will benefit from working
their way through the tutorials.  The tutorials are also being used
effectively by people who are not teachers, as well as with elementary
(5th grade up), middle school, and high school students.

The tutorials, with skill consolidation exercises, cover the essential
features of the LibreOffice Word processor (including mail merge),
Spreadsheet (including formulas, graphing, charting and Lookup Tables),
Database management (including reporting), and Presentation tool
(including many of the relevant skills that apply to teachers) in the
context of the teacher in the K-College classroom.  They also include
a lesson on the LibreOffice drawing tools.

To quote from the LibreOffice Discover website: "LibreOffice is a powerful
office suite; its clean interface and powerful tools let you unleash
your creativity and grow your productivity. LibreOffice embeds several
applications that make it the most powerful Free & Open Source Office
suite on the market: Writer, the word processor, Calc, the spreasheet
application, Impress, the presentation engine, Draw, our drawing and
flowcharting application, Base, our database and database frontend,
and Math for editing mathematics."

This book is available for download free of charge.  As a courtesy to
the author, please drop me a line at poole@pitt.edu to let me know that
you are interested in reading the book and/or are using it to promote
the use of technology in the classroom.

If you are a professor in a School of Education or a Director of
Technology in a School District or system, please feel free to use the
book with your teachers or students.  There is no limit on the number
of copies you may make, provided you comply with the conditions outlined
below.
