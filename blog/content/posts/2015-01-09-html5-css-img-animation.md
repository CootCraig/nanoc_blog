Clouds that move.

## [High Performance Animations](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations/)

We’re going to cut straight to the chase. Modern browsers can animate
four things really cheaply: position, scale, rotation and opacity. If
you animate anything else, it’s at your own risk, and the chances are
you’re not going to hit a silky smooth 60fps.

note that this entire article is discussing a core piece of Chrome’s
rendering architecture that’s changing very fast.


## [Jake Archibald - We’re Gonna Need A Bigger API!](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/03/04/animating-web-gonna-need-bigger-api/)

If you’re performing visual updates with JavaScript, then you should
be using requestAnimationFrame. It synchronizes itself to real screen
updates, giving you as much time as possible to get everything ready
for rendering.

## [David Walsh - Create a CSS Flipping Animation](http://davidwalsh.name/css-flip)

One CSS effect somewhere in between is the CSS flip effect, whereby
there's content on both the front and back of a given container. This
tutorial will show you show to create that effect in as simple a manner
as possible.

## [David Walsh	- CSS Background Animations](http://davidwalsh.name/background-animation-css)

Background animations are an awesome touch when used correctly.  In the
past, I used MooTools to animate a background position.  Luckily these
days CSS animations are widely supported enough to rely on them to
take over JavaScript-based animation tasks.  The following simple CSS
snippet animates the background image (via background position) of a
given element.

## [the-art-of-web.com - CSS: Animation Using CSS Transforms](http://www.the-art-of-web.com/css/css-animation/)

The animations presented below involve setting up a transformation to
take place in response to a mouseover or other event. Then, rather than
applying the effect instantly, we assign a transition timing function
which causes the transformation to take place incrementally over a set
time period.

## [the-art-of-web.com - CSS: Using floats to layout content](http://www.the-art-of-web.com/css/float/)

the use of CSS properties such as float and clear is increasing. But it's
clear that many webmasters have little or no idea on how they actually
work or the variety of ways in which they can be used.

This article focuses on the layout of content within a page, but the
same rules can be applied for layout of the website itself. We start
with the simplest case and work towards the more complicated.

## [justinaguilar.com - CSS3 Animation Cheat Sheet](http://www.justinaguilar.com/animations/)

The CSS3 Animation Cheat Sheet is a set of preset, plug-and-play
animations for your web projects. All you need to do is add the stylesheet
to your website and apply the premade CSS classes to the elements you
want animated.

The CSS3 Animation Cheat Sheet uses CSS3 @keyframes and works on all the
latest browsers (that's IE 10). Using CSS3 @keyframes, you don't have
to worry about positioning the element to accomodate the animations -
it will animate into place. Also for users with older browsers, the
animated element will be visible and in place, even if the animation
doesn't trigger. Below are instructions on how to get started.

In this post we’re going to walk through the basics of CSS
animation. You can follow along and view the CSS code for the example
animations in this post.

## [davidwalsh.name - Detecting CSS Animation Completion with JavaScript](http://davidwalsh.name/css-animation-callback)

The only reason this is a somewhat involved task at this point is the
need to account for browser prefixes.  The transitionend event and
animationend is what standardized browsers require but WebKit-based
browsers still rely on prefixes so we have to determine the prefix for
the event, then apply it:

Imagine how much in JavaScript code you can save by avoiding a JavaScript
library for this.  The duration, fill-mode, and delay can all be set
via CSS, so your JavaScript stays lightweight.  Major win!

## [Mozilla CSS Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

Cascading Style Sheets, most of the time abbreviated as CSS, is a
stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document
written in HTML or XML (including various XML languages like SVG or
XHTML). CSS describes how the structured element must be rendered on
screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

## [quackit.com - css page](http://www.quackit.com/css/)

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows web authors to apply styles to their
web pages. More importantly, CSS enables them to do this independently
of the HTML that makes up each web page.

Therefore, as a web author, you can code your HTML without having to
be concerned with what each HTML element is going to look like. You can
change the look later using CSS.

You'll find a wealth of information about CSS right here on Quackit. Read
the CSS Tutorial, learn all the CSS properties that you can use, or just
go straight to the code for some good old "cut & paste"!

## [jQuery-Keyframes at github](https://github.com/jQueryKeyframes/jQuery.Keyframes)

jQuery-Keyframes allows dynamic generation of CSS3 keyframes with callback
events and other niceness.  Overview

With the rise of CSS3 and HTML5, we see more and more usage of fancy
features like transformations, translations, rotations and scaling. jQuery
has a very nice built in $(selector).animate() function which allows
for easy setup of these animations. However, jQuery's animate() does
not support multiple keyframes. jQuery.Keyframes helps you accomplish
just that.

### [jQueryKeyframes plugin Keyframes.Pathfinder](https://github.com/jQueryKeyframes/Keyframes.Pathfinder)

This plugin for jQuery.Keyframes generates complex movement paths.

### [jQueryKeyframes plugin Keyframes.Spritesheet](https://github.com/jQueryKeyframes/Keyframes.Spritesheet)

Keyframes.Spritesheet is a plugin for jQuery.Keyframes that easily
generates css3 keyframes for elements using animated spritesheets.
