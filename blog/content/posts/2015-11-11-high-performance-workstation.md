OpenCL vs CUDA

<a href="http://vispy.readthedocs.org/en/v0.3.0/gl.html" target="_blank">OpenGL ES 2.0 API</a>

The vispy.gloo.gl namespace provides the OpenGL ES 2.0 API, Consisting
of 302 constants and 129 functions vispy.gloo.gl


<a href="http://api.vispy.org/en/latest/#using-vispy" target="_blank">Using VisPy</a>

VisPy is a young library under heavy development at this time. It targets
two categories of users:

1. Users knowing OpenGL, or willing to learn OpenGL, who want to create beautiful and fast interactive 2D/3D visualizations in Python as easily as possible.
1. Scientists without any knowledge of OpenGL, who are seeking a high-level, high-performance plotting toolkit.

If you’re in the first category, you can already start using
VisPy. VisPy offers a Pythonic, NumPy-aware, user-friendly interface
for OpenGL ES 2.0 called gloo. You can focus on writing your GLSL code
instead of dealing with the complicated OpenGL API - VisPy takes care
of that automatically for you.

If you’re in the second category, we’re starting to build experimental
high-level plotting interfaces. Notably, VisPy now ships a very basic
and experimental OpenGL backend for matplotlib.

nVIDIA Quadro cards

These are high-end cards for CAD.

The Nvidia GeForce line of GT and GTX line of video cards work well
with Rhino.

The GT 200's and 300/s seem quite fast. nVIDIA FERMI-based GeForce cards
(ie. GeForce FX 400 and 500 series) do work, but are not showing the
performance increase we expect from the more expensive cards. In fact,
in some cases they have been slower then the 200 or 300 series cards.
