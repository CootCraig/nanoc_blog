The author of the Apostles-Creed.Org is me, James Richardson. I was born
in a Roman Catholic home. I went to church at a very young age and was
baptized in the Roman Catholic church. It wasnâ€™t till my parents were
divorced when I was removed from the church completely. For most of my
childhood I never went to church. Through a series of unfortunate events
and turmoil, I went back to live with my Mother who gradually brought
me back into the church.
