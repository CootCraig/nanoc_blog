TopMod is based on a new paradigm that allows dynamically changing
the topology of 2-manifold polygonal meshes. The new paradigm always
guarantees topological consistency of polygonal meshes.

Based on our paradigm, by simply adding and deleting edges,handles
can be created and deleted, holes can be opened or closed, polygonal
meshes can be connected or disconnected. These edge insertion and edge
deletion operations are highly consistent with subdivision algorithms. In
particular, these operations can easily be included into a subdivision
modeling system such that the topological changes and subdivision
operations can be performed alternatively during model construction.

TopMod demonstrates practical examples of topology changes based on this
new paradigm and show that the new paradigm is convenient, effective,
efficient, and friendly to subdivision surfaces
