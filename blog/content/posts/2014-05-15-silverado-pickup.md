Select the color for your 2002 Chevrolet Silverado below by clicking
on any item in the corresponding row. After the color is selected, just
click the "choose your color" button to see the products we offer with
that color!

Make Note: The color code will be located on a sticker named Parts
Identification. The code can start with BC/CC followed by a U, or a WA
with a four digit number/letter combination. We use the WA format for
simplicity, your code may have a U. WA8555 is the same as U8555. Click
here for Chevy paint code location chart and paint code label examples.

#### Paint Codes Locations For Chevrolet

The paint code for all Chevy cars and trucks are located on the service
parts identification sticker. While the sticker is moved around from
year to year, it still looks like the ones below. Most labels are white
paper sticker, while more moderns ones are a silver label. While most
paint codes in our database start out with a "WA", most cars and trucks
will start out with a "BC/CC    U". BC/CC stands for basecoat/clearcoat,
and the U stands for upper or body color.
