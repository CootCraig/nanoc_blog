13mm threads on drain plug

## <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Vulcan_engine" target="_blank">wikipedia</a> Ford Vulcan Engine

The Vulcan is a straightforward pushrod design, with 2 valves per
cylinder. Its bore is 89.0 mm (3.50 in) and its stroke is 80.0 mm (3.15
in). The engine was designed to use electronic fuel injection from the
start (there was never a carburetor-equipped version), and was also sold
in a "flexible fuel" configuration that could burn normal gasoline, E85 (a
blend of 15% gasoline and 85% ethanol) or any mixture of these two fuels.
