Thanks for the Instructable! This is very similar to a 2-compartment model
I made 6 or 9 years ago based on a plan from (IIRC) Lowe's website. I
left it behind at a rental when we bought a house and moved 2 years
ago and have just been mounding our compost for that time. Built this
yesterday and so far I've gotten about half of it moved into the new bin.

Here's a composting tip: rather than do a proper turning every few weeks
I'll blend and fluff with a bulb auger in a cordless drill once a week
and turn every alternate month or three.

It takes a LOT of rain to wash the nutrients out ... most places don't
even get enough to replace the water lost by evaporation ... and then
it's a simple matter to collect the run-off with some sort of drip
pan. Voila! ... instant compost tea.

This pile is the minimum size recommended. Better to use a 4 ft cube,
if possible. It holds heat and moisture better than a 3 ft. cube but
isn't so heavy as to force an anaerobic pile. Use the same design,
but make the overall dimensions 4' x 4' x 12' if you have the room.
