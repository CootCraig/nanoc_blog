#### Tennessee

I use a LOT of rattle can lacquer, especially on many of the items I
sell in my gallery.  I have been using and favoring Deft for a long time,
and also keep it in bulk for use in my spray gun equipment.

Recently, I tried a fairly new Rustoleum lacquer in a green and white
rattle can, which retails for less than half of the Deft. So far, I like
it. It dries a bit shiner, but after rubbing it out and putting on the
paste wax, I did two golf club hat racks in less than three hours, start
to finished. They looked very good. The temps were in the mid 60â€™s,
and I sprayed it outdoors.

If you want to finish in one day, rattle can lacquer and paste wax.
