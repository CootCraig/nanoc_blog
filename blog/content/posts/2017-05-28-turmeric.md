  Turmeric
</h3>

Turmeric is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial plant (Curcuma longa)
of the ginger family, Zingiberaceae. It is native to southern Asia,
requiring temperatures between 20 and 30 °C (68 and 86 °F) and a
considerable amount of annual rainfall to thrive. Plants are gathered
annually for their rhizomes and propagated from some of those rhizomes
in the following season.

When not used fresh, the rhizomes are boiled for about 30–45
minutes and then dried in hot ovens, after which they are ground into
a deep-orange-yellow powder commonly used as a coloring and flavoring
agent in the cuisines of Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Iran and Pakistani
cuisine, especially for curries, as well as for dyeing.

Although long-used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat various diseases,
there is little high-quality clinical evidence for use of turmeric or
its main constituent, curcumin, as a therapy.

Consumerlab is what now, $29 a year?  If you are going to take
supplements, just pay it.

Anytime I try to copy and paste even a sentence from one of their reviews,
they remind me that the content is copyrighted. I try to respect that.

Curcumin, for me, is a core supplement.  I do believe almost
everybody over 40 could benefit. Anticancer, (breast,colon,prostate),
antiAlzheimers, antiOsteoarthritis.  This diabetes study makes sense.
Thanks Searcher.

One of the biggest problems with Curcumin is absorption.  In the above
study, the curcumin was concentrated to 75 -85%, used at a dosage
of 750mg twice a day.  There was nothing added to enhance absorption.
Black pepper helps a little.  Longevida or Meriva are better.  Now Foods
just started using Longevida technology, Meriva is used by many suppliers
including Jarrow.

I take some daily.
