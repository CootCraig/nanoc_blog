  Barry Sears - Mythologies of Fish Oil
  <a href="https://www.drsears.com/overview-of-anti-inflammatory-nutrition/components/mythologies-fish-oil/" target="_blank">drsears.com/overview</a>
</h1>

using a 2:1 ratio of EPA and DHA provides the best clinical benefits as
it ensures there will be adequate levels of both EPA and DHA.

<h4>What is the correct ratio of EPA to DHA that will provide maximum health benefits?</h4>

What is important is not the ratio of EPA and DHA in a supplement, but
the ratio of AA/EPA in the blood.  The AA/EPA ratio provides insight into
the potential balance of the initiation of inflammation and its eventual
resolution.  The ideal AA/EPA ratio is between 1.5 and 3 as found in the
Japanese population.  For comparison, the AA/EPA ratio in the American
population is 18.  The higher the AA/EPA ratio, the less likely you are
to have sufficient ability to resolve inflammation therefore creating
chronic low-level inflammation that is the underlying cause of virtually
all chronic disease.  DHA levels will always be higher than EPA levels in
the blood because of the continuing metabolism of EPA into DHA. I have
found that using a 2:1 ratio of EPA and DHA provides the best clinical
benefits as it ensures there will be adequate levels of both EPA and DHA.
You need them both because they have different functions.

<h4>High-dose Omega-3 Fatty Acids</h4>

It is often difficult to obtain adequate levels of omega-3 fatty acids
(EPA and DHA) that are the molecular building blocks to produce a
specialized group of hormones known as resolvins.  Resolvins are critical
to the resolution of inflammation. Without adequate levels of these
omega-3 fatty acids in the blood, it is impossible to make adequate
levels of resolvins to return the body back to equilibrium after the
initiation of inflammation. If the initiation phase of inflammation is
too strong or the resolution phase is too weak, the result is chronic
cellular inflammation. To achieve adequate levels of resolvin formation,
a healthy person will require a minimum of 2.5 grams per day of EPA
and DHA. For those with an existing chronic inflammatory disease, the
levels of EPA and DHA required can be considerably higher to increase
the resolution of existing cellular inflammation.

  SPECIAL TOPICS  »  The Omegas (3, 6, 9)  »  High dose (1800 mg/day) EPA (fish oil) Regenerates HDL Function
  <a href="http://www.heartlifetalk.com/forums/default.aspx?g=posts&m=119098#post119098" target="_blank">heartlifetalk.com/forums/</a>
</h3>

Recent research (2014) confirms what Dr. Barry Sears has long recommended.
In this study, high dose (1800 mg/day) EPA was shown to be efficiently
incorporated into HDL particles and improve HDL function and promotes
cholesterol efflux from macrophages.

I have long taken EPA:DHA at 2:1 ratio or 2660 mg EPA: 1300 mg DHA
for total of about 4000 mg/day based on Dr. Barry Sears recommendation
to control inflammation.  This is close to my heart (no pun intended)
since I am sure it was a significant factor in regression.

This was part of a different approach I examined to prevent the genesis
of atherosclerosis, rather than what most on other sites promoted
(calcification focus). With 2:1 EPA:DHA fish oil and increased oleic
acid (EVOO, omega-9), it reduces the amount of arachidonic acid in LDL
particles that causes oxidization of LDL particles.

So, it is good to know that there are HDL "regeneration" benefits to
EPA's anti-inflammatory properties.

The best source of information on O3, O6, and inflammation is Dr. Barry
Sears (books and website):

<h4>One of the highest concentrations of omega-3s</h4>

Viva Naturals Omega-3 Fish Oil gives you 2,000 mg of omega-3s, 1,400
mg of EPA and 480 mg of DHA per serving. That’s 3x more than many
leading omega 3 supplements (to get the same amount from some others,
you’d have to take 4-6 pills a day). So it’s a potent, convenient
way to get the benefits of fish oil pills you’re looking for, like
heart and brain support.

<h4>Easy to absorb</h4>

Our fish oil delivers its omega-3s in triglyceride form, shown to
be better absorbed than another form called ethyl esters. They’re
easy-to-swallow softgels, too. So when it comes to helping you make the
most of omega-3s, we’ve got you covered.

<h4>Unique extraction method cuts fishy burps</h4>

No one wants to deal with fishy burps or aftertaste, so we cut the chance
through a method called supercritical extraction. It’s just a fancy
way of saying that we separate out the omega-3s using carbon dioxide,
rather than heat or harsh chemicals. This starves any bacteria hanging
around that would need oxygen to survive, and strips away toxins and
heavy metals.

<h4>IFOS 5-Star certified pure</h4>

We only use small fish (like anchovies, known to have fewer toxins at
the start). They’re caught from the highly-regulated coastal waters of
Peru using sustainable fishing practices. To help you feel great about
your choice, each batch is IFOS 5-Star certified, meeting the highest
international standards for purity and potency.
