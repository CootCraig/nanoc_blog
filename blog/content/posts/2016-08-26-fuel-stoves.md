Classic Burners For Travel & Remote Cooking In use for many decades by wilderness travelers 

For years we have been passionate fans of hand pumped kerosene pressure
lamps, but only recently did we become aware of the fantastic utility
of the same basic heating system for remote camp cooking - like mountain
climbing in the Himalayas or exploration trekking. (In fact, this system
is also still in wide ordinary use in many undeveloped places in the
world.) We located a maker in South Asia, and tested two of his models
that were most appropriate for our recreation environment in the USA. The
results were exciting. The amount of heat (also real local warmth) that
was generated at the burner was very high and could be efficiently and
cheaply maintained for many hours if necessary.

#### DESCRIPTION

The Butterfly #2412 Brass Pressure stove is made from solid brass. It
can be disassembled, sealed, and carried in a backpack. Like pressurized
kerosene lanterns, pressure stoves must be pre-heated with a couple
teaspoons of denatured alcohol. The burning alcohol heats the brass
burner, then when you start pumping, the kerosene rises inside the burner
and vaporizes. The kerosene vapor catches fire and the stove starts. Once
started, the heat from the flame keeps the burner hot enough to continue
the vaporization process, plus the fuel in the tank warms enough to keep
the stove pressurized, so you often don't need to pump.

Included with your brass stove are 3 removable stove supports, 3 pick
tools for cleaning, a wrench to disassemble the burner, and a brass cap
that seals the tank when the burner assembly is removed. The tank is
shown in the sealed position. The cap, when removed, attaches to the
end of the pump so it doesn't get lost.

#### SPECIFICATIONS

It holds .9 litres of fuel.  Height is 21cm (8.25 inches), width 20cm (7.9
inches), weight 1.25kg (2 lbs 12 oz), heat output maximum of 9000 btuh.
It will burn over 3 hours on a tank of fuel.
