In the US, Sprint, Verizon and US Cellular use CDMA. AT&T and T-Mobile use GSM.

<h3>
  Bringing your own smartphone to Verizon: What you need to know
  <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/bringing-your-own-smartphone-to-verizon-what-do-i-need-to-worry-about/" target="_blank">cnet.com/news</a>
</h3>

Verizon and Sprint rely on a network technology known as CDMA for their
voice services. AT&T and T-Mobile use a different technology for voice
known as GSM.

The incompatibility issue is particularly hard for Verizon customers
since you will need a device that supports CDMA for voice. As for 4G
compatibility, you will need to make sure the phone you purchase has
radios that can tune into the frequencies that Verizon uses for LTE.

When it comes to LTE, it's not enough to just look for the frequency,
since some carriers use different slivers of the same frequency for
their LTE networks. So it's more helpful to look at the specific LTE
frequency "band class" that is supported. Band classes are assigned by
a wireless standards organization to ensure manufacturers are using the
same specifications when developing components for devices. This means
that matching LTE frequency band classes is the best way to know if a
device you're buying is compatible with the network you use.

For Verizon, you need to make sure the phone you are purchasing supports
any of these three LTE band classes: LTE band 13 (700 MHz c), band 4
(1700 MHz f) or band 2 (1900 MHz). Just for reference, AT&T and T-Mobile
each support LTE bands 2 and 4. Sprint supports one band class that is
common to Verizon: band 2 (1900 MHz).

Moto G (3rd Gen) Review

But there is something different about the new Moto G. Not only is it
the 3rd version of Motorola’s most successful phone of all time, but
it’s also impossible to ignore. This is a sub-$200 phone that bests
many $400 and above phones in performance, battery life, and style.

With it's ...  2470mAh battery, this phone just goes and goes and goes

Holding this phone reminds me a lot of the original Moto X in that its
curves melt into your palm, all areas of the screen are reachable with
one handed use, and it isn’t so thin that it becomes difficult to
hold. There is a slight texture to the (replaceable) back side, along
with a somewhat sticky phone frame that both help it from slipping around
in your hand. The power and volume button places are in their proper
spots and not at all confusing. And the camera housing, with dimple,
and flash add some much needed flair.

Overall, this phone is refreshing in that it’s not an oversized
behemoth, but it’s just big enough that it feels like a 2015 phone.

This isn’t the best camera you will find in a phone, but it might be
the best you will find in a $200 phone. Motorola, a company that almost
always disappoints in the camera department, appears to be figuring things
out. Not only did they express a major desire and focus for putting out
the best smartphone camera around in the new Moto X Pure Edition, they
seem to have spent some quality time with the Moto G’s shooter as well.

You are looking at shots taken with a 13MP f/2.0 camera that includes
pretty quick auto focus, 1080p video, slow motion shooting, burst mode,
and auto HDR.

As has been the case since dating back to the original Moto X, Motorola is
continuing to push a “pure” Android experience that is accompanied by
their own suite of Moto software on the Moto G (3rd gen). Everything here
is as Google would want it, but then Motorola adds on pure awesomeness,
like Moto Display, Actions, and Assist. We’ve talked on countless
occasions about how Moto Display is one of the few game-changing software
add-ons introduced in years, so we won’t bore you with that here. Just
know that it’s as good as ever, even with the LCD display in the Moto G.

The phone comes loaded with Google’s launcher, the stock dialer and
app drawer, familiar notification and quick settings shade, and system
settings are in the right place. If you know Android, at least the
stock kind, everything is where you expect it to be. Because of that,
and because Motorola has become increasingly good at tightening up
performance, the software experience is one of the best (if not the)
in the business even on a mid-range phone like this.

I don’t really know what else to say, other than, this is how Android
is supposed to be. This is the proper way to improve upon Google’s
mobile operating system.

Moto G (late 2015) review

The Good The new Moto G has improved design, water resistance and a
stepped-up camera. The design and hand feel are great, and the battery
lasts more than a full day.

When I think of what I want in an everyday phone, I think of battery
life, camera, how it feels, and how durable it is. And yeah,
how the screen looks. That's what pretty great about Motorola's
latest update to its midrange budget smartphone, the Moto G: it's a
do-pretty-much-everything-you-need, 5-inch Android smartphone...that
costs less than half of your average premium handset.

It's the lines and curves of the G that make it feel special. Yes, it's a
plastic design, but the way it all comes together feels satisfying. Sure,
the frame is plastic. But from a distance (and even in the hand), it
feels nicer than older G models. I used to love the 2013 Moto X for its
curved design that fit neatly in my palm. The new Moto G has that feel,
but with a slightly larger screen and body. In a lot of ways, it also
reminds me of the Nexus 5 .

Even though it has a 5-inch screen, this phone feels hand- and
pocket-friendly. It's a good medium-size phone by today's gargantuan
standards. The front edge-to-edge Gorilla Glass looks sharp, too. I did,
however, already ding a plastic corner a bit.

The 720p display looks bright and crisp -- you probably won't notice that
it isn't higher-res, because at 294 pixels per inch, this still feels HD
(pixel count is much lower than on the 1080p HD Alcatel Idol 3). And
for a budget phone, the colors and clarity look great (the only issue:
turning to landscape mode when you have sunglasses on creates huge
polarization). The front-facing speakers are pretty loud, too,

Almost feels like a Nexus phone.

Sep 15, 2016 - Verizon Adds Moto G Play to Prepaid Lineup for Just $85

To recap, the Moto G Play features a 5-inch HD (720p) display, 1.2GHz
Snapdragon 410 quad-core processor, 2GB RAM, 16GB storage with SD card
support, 8MP rear camera (f/2.2), front 5MP camera, 2800mAh battery,
water repellent nano-coating, and Android 6.0.1. It’s actually not a
terrible phone on paper, especially at the price.
