<strong>Old Pulteney 12-year:</strong> This is the gentlest of the lot. It
is made in Wick at the northernmost distillery in Scotland. It is 86 proof
and shows cream, citrus, and a bit of barrel. Very pleasant. ($35-$40)

<strong>Caol Ila 12-year:</strong> A beautiful single malt from Islay, an
island I got to know many years ago. It has more sheep than people. Caol
Ila (86 proof) is distilled on the shore in Port Askaig, with views of
Jura across the water. It presents citrus notes upfront and follows with
nut tastes. ($55)

<strong>The Peat Monster:</strong> Compass Box Whisky Company produces
this hefty blend (92 proof). It is a combination of whiskies from Port
Askaig, Isle of Mull, and Speyside. It oozes smoke and peat, but goes
down softly on the swallow with a faint fruity aroma. Full-flavoured,
but it is not a palate-buster. ($55)

<strong>Ardbeg 10-year:</strong> Watch out, this is a big Islay whisky. It
is 92 proof and tastes salty and floods the sinuses with menthol and
pepper and a little smoke. ($45)

<strong>Laphroaig 10-year:</strong> Dear lord, what a brute of a
drink. This single malt is a modest 80 proof, yet this iconic Islay
whisky floods the mouth and head with iodine and peat. Those new to it
declare it medicinal. Perhaps, so. Laphroaig never fails to lift my soul
and warm my body. ($45)
