Life's Journey with the Bible

Let us meet and encourage each other to a life in conversation with God supported by regular Bible reading.

We will be following a Bible reading plan developed by Robert Murry M'Cheyne and published in 1844.

A useful tool is to keep a journal where you copy scripture, meditations on scripture, notes on your walk with God and what is going on in your life.  We will talk about doing this.

The reading plan is available at an online site published by Ben Edgington:

Here is a pdf of the plan:

Edgington has a day by day page at:

D.A. Carson has published the M'Cheyne plan with some commentary in his books: For the Love of God; vols one and two.

QUOTE
This book is for Christians who want to read the Bible, who want to read all the Bible.

One of M'Cheyne's abiding concerns was to encourage his people, and himself, to read the Bible.
UNQUOTE

Another resource is the book "Hearing God in Conversation" by Samuel C. Williamson.  This contains help and affirmation in this endeavor.

Sincerely,

Amos 4:12 Prepare to meet your God, Israel!
The one who forms the mountains, creates the wind,

  makes the morning darkness,
  and moves over the heights of the earth—
  the Lord, the God of heavenly forces is his name!

Psalm 1 The truly happy person
  loves the Lord’s Instruction,
  and they recite God’s Instruction day and night!
They are like a tree replanted by streams of water,
  which bears fruit at just the right time
  and whose leaves don’t fade.
    Whatever they do succeeds.

Then the king went up to the Lord’s temple, together with all the people
of Judah and all the citizens of Jerusalem, the priests and the Levites,
and all the people, young and old alike. There the king read out loud
all the words of the covenant scroll that had been found in the Lord’s
temple. The king stood in his place and made a covenant with the Lord that
he would follow the Lord by keeping his commandments, his instructions,
and his regulations with all his heart and all his being, in order to
fulfill the words of the covenant that were written in this scroll

Numbers 6:22
The Lord spoke to Moses: 
Tell Aaron and his sons:
You will bless the Israelites as follows. 
Say to them:

The Lord bless you and protect you.
The Lord make his face shine on you and be gracious to you.
The Lord lift up his face to you and grant you peace.

They will place my name on the Israelites, 
and I will bless them.
