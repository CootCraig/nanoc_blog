subject: revised: "Life's Journey with the Bible" class

Let us meet and encourage each other to a life in conversation with God supported by regular Bible reading.

We will be following a Bible reading plan developed by Robert Murry M'Cheyne and published in 1844.

A useful tool is to keep a journal where you copy scripture, meditations on scripture, notes on your walk with God and what is going on in your life.  We will talk about doing this.

The reading plan is available at an online site published by Ben Edgington:

Here is a pdf of the plan:

Edgington has a day by day page at:

D.A. Carson has published the M'Cheyne plan with some commentary in his books: For the Love of God; vols one and two.

QUOTE
This book is for Christians who want to read the Bible, who want to read all the Bible.

One of M'Cheyne's abiding concerns was to encourage his people, and himself, to read the Bible.
UNQUOTE

Another resource is the book "Hearing God in Conversation" by Samuel C. Williamson.  This contains help and affirmation in this endeavor.

Your friend in the way of Jesus,
Craig Anderson
