  Top 10 Vines For Hummingbirds By Melinda Myers
</h3>

<h4>Trumpet Honeysuckle</h4>

Trumpet Honeysuckle - Lonicera sempervirens, Zones 4 to 9 - Hummingbirds, butterflies and bees love native honeysuckle

<h4>Mandevilla</h4>

Mandevilla, Annual, Perennial in zones 10 to 11

A drought-tolerant vine that can be grown in a container, hanging basket
or right in the garden, mandevilla thrives in full sun to part shade and
well-drained soil. You’ll find many new cultivars with white, pink,
maroon, crimson and bicolor flowers.

Why we love it: You can overwinter mandevilla indoors in a warm,
sunny location.

<h4>Cup and Saucer Vine</h4>

Cup and Saucer Vine - Cobaea scandens, Annual, Perennial in zones 9 to 11

A vigorous grower, give this vine a sturdy support to climb and display
its cup-shaped, aromatic flowers. The blooms open green and then mature
to purple, lasting about four days. Grow in full sun and provide a bit
of afternoon shade in hotter regions.

Why we love it: The flowers have a sweet musky fragrance and are
reportedly pollinated by bats.

<h4>Scarlet Runner Bean</h4>

Scarlet Runner Bean - Phaseolus coccineus, Annual

Grow scarlet runner bean, a hummingbird favorite, in a sunny spot in your
vegetable or flower garden. You can grow these long vines on a trellis,
arbor or fence. Regular harvesting will keep the plant producing more
pods and its scarlet flowers blossoming.

Why we love it: The red blooms will brighten the landscape and lure
hummingbirds. Plus, the edible beans will amp up your veggie options.
