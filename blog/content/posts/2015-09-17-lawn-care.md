Spotted Spurge and Other Spurges

### Chemical Control

#### Preemergent herbicides

Preemergent herbicides can help prevent spotted spurge outbreaks if
you apply them in late winter before weed seeds germinate. Time the
application, so it occurs before the soil temperature exceeds 55° to
60°F at a depth of 1 inch.

Preemergent herbicides for turf and ornamentals include benefin (Balan),
pendimethalin (Pendulum), isoxaben (Gallery), oryzalin (Surflan),
trifluralin (Treflan, Preen), and dithiopyr (Dimension). Of these,
only pendimethalin, trifluralin, dithiopyr, and oryzalin are available
for use by home gardeners. Combination products such as oryzalin plus
benefin are available to both home gardeners and landscape professionals.

Preemergent chemicals are almost never used in home vegetable gardens,
because chemical residues last for months after application, and product
labels routinely regulate against such use. Herbicide recommendations
for commercial orchard and vegetable crops are available online; see
the UC IPM Pest Management Guidelines.

#### Postemergent herbicides

Postemergent herbicides available to home gardeners include
2,4-D/MCPP/dicamba combination products, triclopyr (Turflon), and
glyphosate (available for both commercial and home landscape use). In
general, 2,4-D and its combinations don't control the larger, more mature
spotted spurge plants.

### Prevention and Maintenance

#### Connect the Dots

Spotted spurge spreads quickly throughout weak areas in your lawn by
producing several thousand seeds per plant. Even though it is a summer
annual, late-season seeds can sprout next spring after lying dormant
during cold temperatures. This warm- weather pest begins seed production
a mere 5 weeks after germination, so early detection and treatment is key.

#### Control Spotted Spurge with Prevention

An easy way to prevent an infestation is to weed your garden before
spotted spurge begins to produce seed. Make sure your lawnmower and
garden tools are clean. Keep a dense, green turf to ensure that this
non-competitive plant won't have room to grow. When these weeds do pop
up, pull them out before they have time to produce seed.

#### Controlling an Infestation of Spotted Spurge

If you've got a large spotted spurge problem in the lawn, apply Weed-B-Gon
Max Plus Crabgrass Control or Weed-B-Gon Max For Southern Lawns according
to label directions. Always follow label directions.
