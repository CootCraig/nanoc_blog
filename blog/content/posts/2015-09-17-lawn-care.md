Spotted Spurge and Other Spurges

### Chemical Control

#### Preemergent herbicides

Preemergent herbicides can help prevent spotted spurge outbreaks if
you apply them in late winter before weed seeds germinate. Time the
application, so it occurs before the soil temperature exceeds 55° to
60°F at a depth of 1 inch.

Preemergent herbicides for turf and ornamentals include benefin (Balan),
pendimethalin (Pendulum), isoxaben (Gallery), oryzalin (Surflan),
trifluralin (Treflan, Preen), and dithiopyr (Dimension). Of these,
only pendimethalin, trifluralin, dithiopyr, and oryzalin are available
for use by home gardeners. Combination products such as oryzalin plus
benefin are available to both home gardeners and landscape professionals.

Preemergent chemicals are almost never used in home vegetable gardens,
because chemical residues last for months after application, and product
labels routinely regulate against such use. Herbicide recommendations
for commercial orchard and vegetable crops are available online; see
the UC IPM Pest Management Guidelines.

#### Postemergent herbicides

Postemergent herbicides available to home gardeners include
2,4-D/MCPP/dicamba combination products, triclopyr (Turflon), and
glyphosate (available for both commercial and home landscape use). In
general, 2,4-D and its combinations don't control the larger, more mature
spotted spurge plants.

### Prevention and Maintenance

#### Connect the Dots

Spotted spurge spreads quickly throughout weak areas in your lawn by
producing several thousand seeds per plant. Even though it is a summer
annual, late-season seeds can sprout next spring after lying dormant
during cold temperatures. This warm- weather pest begins seed production
a mere 5 weeks after germination, so early detection and treatment is key.

#### Control Spotted Spurge with Prevention

An easy way to prevent an infestation is to weed your garden before
spotted spurge begins to produce seed. Make sure your lawnmower and
garden tools are clean. Keep a dense, green turf to ensure that this
non-competitive plant won't have room to grow. When these weeds do pop
up, pull them out before they have time to produce seed.

#### Controlling an Infestation of Spotted Spurge

If you've got a large spotted spurge problem in the lawn, apply Weed-B-Gon
Max Plus Crabgrass Control or Weed-B-Gon Max For Southern Lawns according
to label directions. Always follow label directions.

Getting Rid Of Crab Grass

Crab grass is an annual weed, but it acts like a perennial. It has
what is called an indeterminate growth pattern. Most annual weeds grow
until mature enough to produce seeds, then they die. They have one shot
to reproduce.

Getting rid of crab grass is difficult because it keeps growing all
season, spring through fall. New plant growth, developing seed heads, and
mature seeds will all be present on a plant throughout the warm seasons.

### Steps To Getting Rid Of Crab Grass

Once this troublesome weed has gotten started in your yard, there are
several things you can do to get control over it. The step or stage that
is best for starting will depend on the season in which you begin.

<ul>
  <li>Keep crabgrass seeds from spreading.</li>
  <li>Kill existing crabgrass.</li>
  <li>Remove dead crabgrass plants.</li>
  <li>Replant bare lawn spots with new grass seed.</li>
  <li>Apply a crabgrass preventer at the appropriate times.</li>
  <li>Set your lawnmower at the high end of the range that is best for your grass type.</li>
  <li>Restrict excess fertilizing or too-frequent watering.</li>
  <li>Keep your lawn healthy as the most conducive way to get rid of crabgrass.</li>
</ul>

How To Kill Crabgrass

#### The Slow Way To Kill Crabgrass In Lawns

Put on a pair of gloves. Grab a serrated knife or a V-shaped weeding
tool. Slice into the root of the crabgrass. Pull up the weed and
discard. Repeat.

No fun? But all kidding aside, sometimes that is not a bad approach. You
might be surprised what you can accomplish by taking 15 or 20 minutes
each evening. Start on one side and methodically work your way across
the yard. You can cover a good size area each week this way.

Enlist the help of a family member and have a nice conversation outside
each evening as the air cools. Kids can be surprisingly effective
at this when they are helping you, and not being ordered to do it by
themselves. Just think, you get less exposure to chemical or TV pollution,
while you kill crabgrass for free, plus the bonding!

As a side-note, related to the chemical element, you should be aware
that MSMA is an arsenic based product, and it does leave residue in the
soil. This may be a cause of concern for some individuals or situations,
enough to make the idea of yard "work" seem more attractive.
