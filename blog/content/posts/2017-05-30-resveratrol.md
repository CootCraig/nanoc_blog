Taking Resveratrol? Are you getting more for your money than you ever
knew?

Take this product, as an example:

Healthy Origins Natural Active Trans Resveratrol, 300mg/capsule.

If you look at the label, you will see that you are getting an additional
300mg of junk, inactive residue, and who know what, too -- not to mention
"other ingredients."  I used to take this product. It took me a while
to isolate it but this product would cause abdominal discomfort.

Then I switched to MegaResveratrol,Pharmaceutical Grade 99% Pure
Trans-Resveratrol, 495mg/capsule. No 50% junk residue, inactive
ingredients. Noooo problemo with this product.
