## Bow-Roof Shed/Greenhouse - plans

<a href="http://www.by-the-sea.com/stimsonmarine/bowroof.html" target="_blank">Bow-Roof Shed/Greenhouse - plans</a>

Build your own BOW-ROOF GREENHOUSE/SHED easily using our complete,
easy-to-read plans and step-by-step manual. Great for greenhouse, boat
shed, workshop or garage.

frame.gif The 14' x 32' greenhouse/shed pictured here can be built in
40 hours and $400.00 to $600.00 for materials depending on your location.

For the past nine years, we have used these elegant structures as season
extenders for growing tomatoes, peppers, and other vegetables. This winter
for the first time we are growing cold-weather crops in a cold-frame
inside a Bow-Roof Greenhouse/Shed. The sun is our only heat source,
and yet we have a good crop of kale, spinach, lettuce, and swiss chard
growing here in Maine in January.

Bow-Roof Greenhouse/Sheds are designed to withstand strong winds and
heavy snow loads. Ours have stood up to 70 mph winds and have had snow
piled nine feet high on the sides without collapsing. The low cost of
materials, and ease of construction make these the most economical of
any shelters we have ever seen.

The Bow-Roof Greenhouse/Shed pictured here is used as a storage
building. We've also used these buildings as garages and temporary
workshops. Our plans will tell you how to build a shelter of any width
from 10' to 20' - but 20' is the widest that we would recommend for this
construction method. The length is up to you - 20' to l/2 mile!

bowroof.gif Carpentry experience is certainly helpful, but not
essential. The building manual is geared toward the layperson, and we
have attempted to explain each step clearly, with the help of photographs
where necessary. If you can use a hammer and saw, and read a tape measure,
you can build a Bow-Roof Greenhouse/Shed.

The plans include a 25-page construction manual that will show you
step-by-step how to build your Bow-Roof Greenhouse/Shed using wood
available at your local lumberyard. In the back of the manual you will
find sources for materials, a metric conversion able, and useful tips
on greenhouse utilization.

You can order your Bow-Roof Greenhouse/Shed Plans over the phone
using Visa, MasterCard, Discover, or Amex. Plans & Manual: $18.00 plus
$2.00 p&h.

CSC TEXTILES online, supplies SUNBRELLA which is one of the best fabrics
for outdoor use...

Although it is very well known, a lot of confusion and misconceptions
exist for the non-professional looking to use these products.  It is
well known for its UV-Ray "sun" resistance, color retention, and
water-repellency.  There are also other name brands made very similar
like PARA-Tempotest and Dickson (also owned by the makers of Sunbrella),
and many Other Fabric made similarly, so you are not limited with only
one choice...
