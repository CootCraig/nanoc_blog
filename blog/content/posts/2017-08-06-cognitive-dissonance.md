<h2>
  <a href="http://twoicefloes.com/about/" target="_blank">About Cognitive Dissonance</a>
</h2>


Two Ice Floes is the term Cog and I use to describe the conflict or
cognitive dissonance we experience while trying to live, work, play and
grow in two different realities at the same time.

This website seeks to explore, with Zero Hedge's contributing
editor/author Cognitive Dissonance, the philosophy and application of
acknowledging these conflicts while we attempt to survive the control
system Matrix and thrive and grow even as we create our own personal
reality.

We invite you to come in, look around and join us as both staff and
patients of The Insane Asylum.

Mrs. Cog
