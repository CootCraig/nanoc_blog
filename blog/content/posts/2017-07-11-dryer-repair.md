  Whirlpool 27” Gas Dryer Drive Motor Replacement #279787
</h3>

This video provides step-by-step instructions on replacing the motor in
Whirlpool 27” gas dryers with the lint filter at door. The most common
reasons for replacing the motor are when the dryer makes a humming noise,
stops turning during a cycle, trips a breaker, won’t start, or won’t
turn at all.

All of the information in this motor replacement video is applicable
to the following brands: Whirlpool, Kenmore, Maytag, KitchenAid, Amana,
Inglis

  Maytag dryer drum won't start when hot 
</h3>

I have a Performa Maytag Dryer Model # PYG2000AWW. When the unit is cold,
it will start and run fine. After the first load is done and the dryer
is still hot, I put a new load in from the washer and all I get is a
load buzz but the drum won't spin. I can start the drum manually and
then quickly shut the door and it will work.  I have already replaced
the belt as the unit is over 10 years old. Could it be the solenoid or
the motor? How can I test to see what might be the problem?  Thanks!

Definately the motor, the buzz is the sound a motor makes when it has
what is called a "Locked Rotor".
