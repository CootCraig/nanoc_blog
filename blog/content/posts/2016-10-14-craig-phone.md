#### <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_6760_slide-review-416.php" target="_blank">gsmarena.com</a> Compact messaging - Nokia 6760 slide review 

Quad-band GSM support and 3G with HSDPA 

The new 6760 slide (we'll use its European name from now on) is ultra
compact and the full-QWERTY keyboard is backed by no numpad on top. The
Internet and Messaging shortcuts up front are quite handy though and
make perfect sense in both portrait and landscape hand hold. The neat
messenger is trying to balance features, looks and ergonomics to offer
all-round experience within budget. The absence of Wi-Fi support is a
letdown, but the rest of the features are from the top drawer.

The slide-out QWERTY hardware keyboard is among the best we've tried. The
centrally placed yellow marked numpad will be frequently used, as there's
no front alphanumeric pad on the 6760 slide.

While you're surfing the net or typing a message you will need to press
the yellow Num lock to activate numeric mode. On the homescreen you can
directly enter digits and dial a number.

Dead center on the left side is the microUSB slot covered with a plastic
lid. Mass storage mode is supported by the 6760 slide doesn't charge
off USB.

The nice and compact Nokia 6760 slide has a very friendly feel and near
perfect QWERTY keyboard. It's a shame that part of the impression is
ruined by the wobbly slider and the altogether cheap finish. The lack
of a numpad could be a problem at times when you need to quickly dial
a number. That said, Smart Dial is even more badly missed.

### Paul van der Heu replied

Nokia Suite supports S30, S40 and symbian phones. As such and assuming
you would want to trae up from the N95 the last Symbian phone to be
supported by Nokia Suite would be the Nokia 808PV.

Can I use GSM and CDMA together in one account?

Yes. With Ting, you can have any combination of active GSM and / or CDMA
devices under one account sharing minutes, messages and megabytes. This
is an industry first. We're pretty excited about it.

#### <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2403424,00.asp" target="_blank">pcmag.com LG rumore reflex review</a>

The Rumor Reflex is a dual-band (850/1900 MHz) EV-DO Rev.0 device with
no Wi-Fi. Rev. 0 means the Rumor Reflex gets 3G data speeds, just not
the faster Rev. A speeds. That's fine for texting, but it makes for
slower Web browsing.

Continuous talk time: 5 hours 41 minutes

#### <a href="https://www.cnet.com/products/lg-rumor-reflex-sprint/review/" target="_blank">cnet.com - LG Rumor Reflex (Sprint) review</a>

Front and center is a 3-inch WQVGA capacitive touch screen. Its resolution
is only 400x240 pixels and it can display only 262,000 colors, so it's
not the crispest or most vibrant display out there. Videos and games are
pixelated and images, like its set of default wallpaper, are grainy. On
the upside, though, the simple menu icons and text are legible. Yet,
what I liked most about the display was that it was responsive. I could
scroll through menu items, type on the virtual keyboard (if I didn't
want to use the physical keyboard), and click on links with ease.

The QWERTY keyboard behind the display lights up with a soft blue glow
and has four rows of keys, including directional keys, a function and
shift key, a backspace, and a symbol key that gives you access to 16 cute
icons and smiley faces. However, unless you're sending texts to another
Rumor Reflex, don't expect other devices to be able to see these colorful
emoticons. Although I like that the keys are raised and are easy to push,
they're too small. I have petite hands already, so I can't imagine anyone
with even slightly larger mitts trying to type. The slider mechanism is
sturdy, and easily snaps back and forth.

With its gray plastic build and fishnet stocking texturing, the back
of the phone feels cheap. Near the top left corner is the lens for the
2-megapixel camera, with a small reflective square to the right of it for
vanity shots. Next to that are two small slits for the output speaker. By
a small indentation at the bottom, you can pry the backing of the device
off and gain access to the 1,000mAh battery inside and the microSD slot,
which can accept cards up to 32GB.

In the tools folder, you can access several features, including a clock,
a calendar, Bluetooth 3.0, voice command and voice memo, a calculator,
a notepad, and a document reader, which lets you read files stored on
your memory card.



##### Conclusion

The LG Rumor Reflex has restored my faith in feature handsets. There was
a time when I thought manufacturers simply did not put any effort into
these types of devices anymore. Although it's not great for browsing,
it has a responsive touch screen, simple but solid design, and good call
quality. I'd recommend this device for anyone not interested in a data
plan or the bells and whistles of a smartphone.
