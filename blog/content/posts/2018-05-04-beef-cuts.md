We head to Marksbury Farm Market where we learn about every piece and
part of the cow and where they are located, and how to butcher them to
take to market. We bring home our own oxtail and beef tongue for two
tasty recipes, Oxtail Stew and Smoked Beef Tongue. These tasty recipes
are simple, but not quick. The longer the smoke, the longer the simmer,
the better the flavor...

This video was filmed on location at one of Australia’s most awarded
butcher shops “The Hot Canary” in Bowral NSW. We follow along with
master butcher Mick as he breaks down a side of beef. Learning where
each cut of meat actually comes from on a beast is valuable learning
and Mick gives us some really good tips on what to look for when buying
steak and how he prepares his favourite cut of meat.

<h2>filet mignon</h2>

Order untrimmed beef tenderloin?

<h3>
  What Is Filet Mignon?  By Peggy Trowbridge Filippone
  <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-filet-mignon-1807016" target="_blank">thespruceeats.com/what-is</a>
</h3>

<h4>Origins of Filet Mignon</h4>

Filet mignon is French, of course, with filet meaning "thick slice"
and mignon meaning "dainty." It first appears in American print in 1899.

Filet mignon comes from the small end of the tenderloin (called the
short loin) which is found on the back rib cage of the animal. This area
of the animal is not weight-bearing, thus the connective tissue is not
toughened by exercise. The result is extremely tender meat.

The actual muscle used is the psoas major. It sits beneath the ribs,
next to the backbone, and gets thicker from its pointy end at the ribs
to the rear of the animal. As in humans, it is a hip flexor muscle. It
has its origins on the lumbar vertebrae and the last rib and inserts
on the trochanter of the femur, the largest leg bone. There are two
tenderloins for each animal.

The center cut of the tenderloin is used for steaks including the filet
mignon, Chateaubriand steak, and beef Wellington. Chateaubriand is cut
from the thicker end of the tenderloin. Porterhouse and T-bone steaks
include the filet mignon as the medallion of meat on one side of the bone.

<h4>Cutting the Filet Mignon From the Tenderloin</h4>

The tenderloin term applies to the entire strip of tenderloin meat,
whereas slices of the tenderloin are termed filet mignon. Filet mignon
slices found in the market are generally 1 to 2 inches thick and 2 to 3
inches in diameter, but true mignons are no more than 1 inch in diameter
and are taken from the tapered end.

These steaks are naturally rounded as they come from the tube-shaped
end of the muscle.

The silver-skin is usually removed so as not to give the steak a tougher
area to chew. The fat is usually well-trimmed, although if left intact
it produces more flavor.

<h3>
  What Are Filet Mignon and Beef Tenderloin?  by Paul Edmondson

</h3>

<h4>Beef Tenderloin vs Filet Mignon: What's the Difference?</h4>

Telling the difference between the beef tenderloin and filet mignon can
be a little confusing if you're not used to selecting cuts of beef. I
once asked my sister-in-law to pick up a beef tenderloin from Costco
and she came home with pork loin!

Beef tenderloin is the name of the large cut of beef before it is
sliced into steak. Once it is cut into steaks, those steaks are known
by the French name,"filet mignon." I've seen steaks labeled as "beef
tenderloin" steaks in the market, and they are the same as filet mignon
steaks. However, you'll never see a whole, uncut beef tenderloin labeled
as "filet mignon."

To turn a beef tenderloin into filet mignon, all you have to do is
take a very sharp butcher's knife and slice the beef tenderloin into
2-inch steaks across the grain of the meat. Once it's sliced, you have
filet mignon.

<h4>Trimmed vs. Untrimmed Beef Tenderloin</h4>

There are two types of beef tenderloin; the trimmed version of the beef
tenderloin and the untrimmed version. The trimmed version has the fat
and silver skin from the cow's sides largely removed and is smoothly cut
with the side medallion taken out. The trimmed version is more expensive
since it has less fat and waste than untrimmed. The trimmed version is
my favorite since it doesn't require any special preparation.

The untrimmed version is a great way to get super high-quality beef
at prices similar to those of New York steaks and rib-eye steaks. The
untrimmed version requires more preparation since you have to trim it
yourself. The process of trimming a beef tenderloin is also known as
"peeling." The medallion is removed first by following the seam down the
length of the tenderloin with a sharp knife. Next, the fat and silver skin
is peeled and sliced off. Long strips of fat film can be easily pulled
off with your hands. Some people like to leave the fat on and to cook it
off on the grill, but I prefer to remove it. The silver skin is tougher
than the other fat and won't break down when cooking, so it's highly
recommended to pull it off. It has a "silver" sheen, it's thin and it
runs the length of a large beef tenderloin. Filet mignon (beef tenderloin)
has plenty of fat in the meat already. Trimming it off is the way to go!

As owner of Heritage Meats, an artisan butcher shop that specializes
in organic, locally grown and sustainable meat products and services,
Tracy Smaciarz (http://heritagemeatswa.com/) can also tell a lot about
a particular animal by visiting them at the farm. "I can tell you when
to slaughter them and why to slaughter them based on the portion sizes
that you're going to get out of those cuts of meat," he says. As we see
in the video, Smaciarz also visits one of his clients, Tracey Baker of
The Gleason Ranch, where he emphasizes the quality of care and treatment
that her grass fed cattle receive.  Read the full story:

review - Exemplary Text by A Professional By James Ellsworth - July 9, 2014
</h4>

I bought this book for several reasons: one of my grandfathers did his
own slaughtering and butchering and he also had a restaurant. I cook and
I have had an interest that goes back to food tv pioneer, Merle Ellis and
'Cutting Up In The Kitchen.' Merle's idea was that frugal persons could
better feed their families by purchasing sub-primal cuts and doing a
little of the high-priced butcher work at home. This book makes the
same philosophy much more do-able with step-by-step photographs and
'new generation' text material.
