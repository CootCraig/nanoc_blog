<pre>
Due to an increase in requests for my 1985 booklet Back to Basics
Reform Or...OBE *Skinnerian International Curriculum? (48 pages),
which is now out-of-print, the author has decided to make the booklet
available free on this website. This will enable the reader to
understand how the long-planned controversial restructuring of
education from academics to workforce training, necessary for the
planned global economy and United States participation in a socialist
world government, was finalized between 1980 and the present time, and
to take action to put a stop to education restructuring.

Although the 150-year history of this unconstitutional agenda is
documented in the deliberate dumbing down of america...A Chronological
Paper Trail, 1999, Back to Basics Reform Or...... lets the reader
peek into the laboratory of the change agents at the U.S. Department of
Education in the early eighties, when and where the author worked as a
Senior Policy Advisor, with access to confidential planning. The
author was fired for leaking a very important document to the press.
However, since she knew she would get fired for doing so, she managed
to remove all the incriminating documents from her office prior to
leaking the one most important document. Much of the information
gleaned from these purloined documents is found in "Back to Basics
Reform Or...".

John Taylor Gatto (born December 15, 1935) is an American author and
former school teacher who taught in the classroom for nearly 30 years. He
devoted much of his energy to his teaching career, then, following his
resignation, authored several books on modern education, criticizing its
ideology, history, and consequences. He is best known for the underground
classic Dumbing Us Down: the Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling,
and The Underground History of American Education: A Schoolteacher’s
Intimate Investigation Into the Problem of Modern Schooling, which is
sometimes considered to be his magnum opus.

He was named New York City Teacher of the Year in 1989, 1990, and 1991,
and New York State Teacher of the Year in 1991.
