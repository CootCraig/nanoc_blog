### AdaFruit

* [AdaFruit - Hook-up Wire Spool Set - 22AWG Solid Core - 6 x 25 ft - $15.95](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1311)

Perfect for bread-boarding, free wiring, etc. This box contains 6 spools
of solid-core wire. The wire is easy to solder to and when bent it keeps
its shape pretty well. We like to have a few spools of this stuff around
which is why this set is quite nice! We suggest picking up wire strippers
to match. Wire gauge is 22 AWG which we've found is the best all-around
gauge, it works best with breadboards and perfboards but also fits in
terminal blocks nicely

This box has a wooden dowel rod to hold the spools in place and let them
spin, and there are little punch-outs you can pass the wire through so
its it'll stay nice organized.

### [Mogami W2330 Interconnect Wire](https://tubedepot.com/products/mogami-w2330-interconnect-wire)

$0.59 / ft.

The Mogami name is synonymous with high quality and is used worldwide in
the best recording studios. With a diameter of only 3mm / 0.118 inches,
this cable was designed for excellent sound in a compact package. Using
high purity copper shielding ensures very low noise, while the high
purity copper center conductor conveys ultimate tone. Special nylon
tensile strengtheners inside the conductor yield mechanical strength
that is much higher than any comparable diameter cable. The cross-linked
polyethylene dielectric is heat resistant and will not shrink as quickly
as pvc. If you want the best wire to go from your front panel controls
to your preamp tubes, then this is it. Another cool aspect of this cable
is it uses low noise cross link poly insulation, so is relatively non
microphonic in high impedance circuits...like tube amps.

* Part No.: W2330
* No. of Conductor: 1
* Conductor Size(mm2): 0.08mm2(#28 AWG)
* Insulation Material: LNXLPE (Low Noise Cross - Linked polyethylene)
* Insulation Color: Clear
* Jacket Ov. Dia.(mm): 3.0Ø (0.118")
* Jacket Material: Flexible PVC
* Jacket Color: Black

### [Gepco - Single & Dual-pair: 22 Gage](http://www.gepco.com/products/proav_cable/analog_audio/singdual_22_F.htm)

Industry standard balanced audio cable for permanent
installation. Stranded tinned-copper conductors are easy to solder or
punch-down. A high grade polyethylene dielectric is used to minimize high
frequency attenuation, while excellent process control and tight pair
twisting achieves superior noise rejection. Foil shield with same gage
drain wire facilitates quick shield termination. Twentytwo gage conductors
offer the lowest DCR available in any Gepco single-pair product. Ideal for
punch-down, rack wiring, and extended distance runs of mic level signals.

72401EZ	1	24 AWG (7X32) Stranded

* [Markertek Gepco 72401EZ](http://www.markertek.com/Cables/Bulk-Wire-Cable/Bulk-Audio-Cable/Gepco/72401EZ-BK.xhtml)

Thin profile, balanced audio cable for applications that require a
reduced diameter and/or weight. Stranded tinned-copper conductors are
easy to solder or punch-down. A high-quality polyethylene insulation
minimizes cable capacitance in conjunction with excellent process control
and tight twisting for superior noise rejection. Foil shield with same
gage drain wire facilitates quick shield termination. Twenty-four gage
conductors are easier to terminate while still maintaining low DCR. Ideal
for patchbay wiring or mobile production trucks.
