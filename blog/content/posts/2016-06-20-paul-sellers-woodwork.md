# Hand Planes

<ul>
  <li>Stanley or Record pre 1970</li>
  <li>The #4, #4 1/2, #5 and #5 1/2 planes can be bought for under £30 if you shop wisely</li>

</ul>

I reach equally and without preference between Stanleys and Records. This
tells me a lot. It’s a mix of  reasons but two that keep me firmly
impressed that my choice is right for me. I prefer thinner irons because
when properly sharpened and set they don’t chatter and the steel in both
plane types sharpen up quickly, being only half as thick as  irons made
by more prominent makers of today, and take and hold a good sharp edge. I
also like the lightness of these planes which of course is counter to
everything we are being told today. More on this elsewhere on my blog. For
most of the people I know and meet, cost is an important factor. 
The #4, #4 1/2, #5 and #5 1/2 planes can be bought for under £30 if you shop
wisely. Even well maintained ones can be had for this. I use Stanley and
Record planes over  and more than all others, but I like other planes too.

A #5 jack is excellent for luthier work and will straighten and thin
all of your stock for fronts, backs and sides and it will do that within
thousandths of an inch as needed. The jack plane measures around 35.5cm
(14”) long and has an overall width of  64mm (2 1/2”). More than
sized for making guitars, violins and cellos too.
