Boiled Linseed Oil & Metal

A lesser known use for BLO is to protect metal from oxidation. You can
apply a thin coat to non-moving parts and once dry it will protect and
beautify the surface. Thick coats can get gummy which is another reason
you don’t want to use this in moving parts which get stuck together.

I use it mainly for chisels, screwdrivers, heirloom tools, block planes,
and more specifically cast iron tops of my “Big-Boy” tools in the
shop like the table saw, mortiser, and band saw.

Sand off the rust and polish the metal with some 0000 steel wool then
wipe on a thin coat of BLO and you’re good to go.

## Sealing Concrete

#### crazy idea- linseed oil for concrete sealer??

Linseed oil has been used for years to seal concrete. Mix it 50/50
with kerosene or mineral spirits and slosh it on with sprayer or
roller. It’s not the best or longest lasting...expect to re-apply it
to concrete outside every year or two. Will darken the concrete at first
but lightens after a while.

And the smell does linger for a while.
