<h4>Project Description</h4>

Writer2ePub (W2E) is an extension for OpenOffice.org or LibreOffice
which allows you to create an ePub file from any file format that Writer
can read.

You can easily generate an ePub of professional quality that you can edit
with the appropriate ePub-authoring tools later. Moreover, W2E fixes
several formatting errors and generates by default a logical layout,
in line with the traditional editorial standards.

<h4>What Writer2ePub Is</h4>

W2E is an ePub file creator. It allows you to easily create an ePub
file of high quality, at code-level and as typographic result. You do
not need to worry about editing and typesetting anymore!

W2E main features include:

<ul>
  <li>generated code (XHTML, CSS and XML) is extremely clean and simple</li>
  <li>the final ePub is very easy to edit with ePub editors like Sigil</li>
  <li>high compatible with the most common eReader programs/platforms: iPad, Adobe Digital Editions</li>
  <li>automatic correction of wrong formatting</li>
  <li>metadata can be managed with simplicity and flexibility</li>
</ul>

The beginner might want to use W2E as a simple file converter. To obtain a
good ePub file, you just need to open any file that can be read by Writer
(OO or LibO) and click a button!

Also advanced users can profit from W2E. In fact, they will get a
validated ePub, ready to enter further processing stages, being sure
that it will be compatible with nearly all the devices on the market.
