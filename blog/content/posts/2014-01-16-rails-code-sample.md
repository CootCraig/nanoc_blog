## Rails Code Sample Recommendation

### Dan Pickett, Co-Founder at Launch Academy 

We recommend to our students at Launch Academy (www.launchacademy.com) that they produce something they're passionate about. 

For some, it's a nagging problem that they've wanted to solve for
themselves. Examples from our current cohort include a distraction
tracking application and a a responsively designed flash card app that
helps you study, For others, it's around a hobby or something that came
up among friends. Someone in our current class is building a restroom
finder app for their sister because of a particularly challenging time
they had in Maine one weekend :-). For many others, apps originate as
startup ideas or to satiate a need they had at their previous job. One
student is building a really cool app that puts patients on a stand by
list for doctors if there are cancellations.

The common denominator in all of the projects is that there is a story to
tell where they've found a pain and built an application as a means to
heal it. We find it creates a great dialog during the interview process
that way.

Our students (Launchers) get particularly hung up if the idea has already been done. Remember the goal: it's to showcase your coding abilities. Don't get it confused with building an MVP that you can raise funding for. It doesn't have to be a revolutionary idea - it just has to provide a challenging opportunity for you to show what you can do.

We call it a "breakable toy" because we aim for it to show a path of
development and improvement. Having an interest in the domain is critical,
because it encourages you to keep surmounting the technical challenges.

### We recommend the following technical components be included:

* An ER diagram demonstrating an interesting or compelling data model
* API integration of some kind (can content be syndicated to facebook or twitter? Is there an interesting source of data you can tie in with?)
* Authentication and authorization
* Use of well tested service objects or Plain Old Ruby Objects (POROs) to demonstrate an understanding of ruby fundamentals
* Integration of some interesting third party code like state_machine, simple_form, or JQuery plugins for an appropriate reason
* A responsive or mobile-first design
* Some JavaScript that interacts with a JSON endpoint via AJAX (ideally with unit tests)
* A rich commit history that shows the evolution of the application and your learnings as a developer. Refactor commits are great for this type of thing!
