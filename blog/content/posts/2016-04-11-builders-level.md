### <a href="http://www.johnsonlevel.com/News/TransitLevelsAllAboutTran" target="_blank">johnsonlevel.com - All About Transit Levels</a>

A transit level is an optical instrument, or a telescope, complete with
a built-in spirit level that is mounted on a tripod. Transit levels are
used mainly for surveying and building, but they can be used to determine
the relative position of lines and objects as well. Transit levels are
very precise. They are used to establish a reference line, but they are
also used to provide readings of angles in precise measurements.

##### basswood - 

The Empire True Blue levels are my
favorite. It is also nice that they cost much less than Stabila, and
have a Lifetime warranty

I've had several Stabila and Empire levels and they are all still accurate after a decade or more... so I have not seen any difference except price and color. Just my experience.

They don't get much abuse in my work.

The new Empires seem well made. I've had the True Blue for just a couple of years, no problems so far. I like the vials better than Stabila.

I know how strong the loyalty to Stabila is though (and for good reason).

As I was working today and had several different levels out, I thought this would make for a lively discussion.

By the way, Empire invented the torpedo level and is based in WI... they probably have more of a following here in the Midwest. 
Warren  - Oh boy Bass its on now. I have framed for 25 years
and no level comes close to matching the stabila. I have had them for the
last 10 years and they still read true. Probably had 1/2 dozen others,
empire, johnson etc. Maybe for you trim guys who dont have to worry bout
weather,mud,drops,etc others may be close but to us framers its not even
a debate.

##### loneframer - 

I have a 6' a 4' and a 2' Empire blue. Loved them for about 6
months, then they started reading differently. Now I'm back with Stabila
for good

##### kmac - 

It's hard to buy a level at the store that's true! Half the ones
on the rack are out of calibration before you even bring them home -
check it out for yourself. Stabila all the way no question best levels
you can buy and worth every penny.

##### graham j - 

This may be heresy, but have you gentlemen used any of the
Stanley FatMax Extreme levels? We as a company have about four, I think,
and they seem to have an accuracy warranty that is at least equal to the
Stabila, and they have a lifetime warranty as well. We also have a couple
of 5' Stabilas around the job. Had a sweet 6' stabila, but it has not
showed up for work for about 18 months. No idea where it walked off to.

I have both, so I am wondering what you all think?
