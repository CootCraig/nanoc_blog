  Amazon Announces "AWS Secret" Service For The CIA, US Intelligence
</h3>

<h4>Announcing the New AWS Secret Region</h4>

We are pleased to announce the new AWS Secret Region. The AWS Secret
Region can operate workloads up to the Secret U.S. security classification
level. The AWS Secret Region is readily available to the U.S. Intelligence
Community (IC) through the IC’s Commercial Cloud Services (C2S)
contract with AWS. The AWS Secret Region also will be available to non-IC
U.S. Government customers with appropriate Secret-level network access
and their own contract vehicles for use of the AWS Secret Region. These
contract vehicles will not be part of the IC’s C2S contract.

With the launch of this new Secret Region, AWS becomes the first and
only commercial cloud provider to offer regions to serve government
workloads across the full range of data classifications, including
Unclassified, Sensitive, Secret, and Top Secret. By using the cloud,
the U.S. Government is better able to deliver necessary information and
data to mission stakeholders.

The Liquidity Pyramid Part I By James Cox
</h3>

The Liquidity Pyramid is a model created by John Exter (1910 – 2006) an
American economist, member of the Board of Governors of the United States
Federal Reserve System and founder of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

In the 1950’s he started to explain the economy in terms of an inverted
pyramid. The basic idea of the liquidity pyramid was to convey the concept
of how easily an asset could be bought or sold. In other words – how
liquid it is. At the top, he placed the most risky, least liquid assets
and at the bottom, the least risky, most liquid assets.
Here, it might be helpful to consider the idea of ‘wealth.’ We do not really own anything; merely we have claims to ‘things.’ ‘Wealth’ is a claim to or a command of resources (land, labour, capital) that have the potential to make life ‘better’.
