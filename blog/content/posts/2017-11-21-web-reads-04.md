  Amazon Announces "AWS Secret" Service For The CIA, US Intelligence
</h3>

<h4>Announcing the New AWS Secret Region</h4>

We are pleased to announce the new AWS Secret Region. The AWS Secret
Region can operate workloads up to the Secret U.S. security classification
level. The AWS Secret Region is readily available to the U.S. Intelligence
Community (IC) through the IC’s Commercial Cloud Services (C2S)
contract with AWS. The AWS Secret Region also will be available to non-IC
U.S. Government customers with appropriate Secret-level network access
and their own contract vehicles for use of the AWS Secret Region. These
contract vehicles will not be part of the IC’s C2S contract.

With the launch of this new Secret Region, AWS becomes the first and
only commercial cloud provider to offer regions to serve government
workloads across the full range of data classifications, including
Unclassified, Sensitive, Secret, and Top Secret. By using the cloud,
the U.S. Government is better able to deliver necessary information and
data to mission stakeholders.

The Liquidity Pyramid Part I By James Cox
</h3>

The Liquidity Pyramid is a model created by John Exter (1910 – 2006) an
American economist, member of the Board of Governors of the United States
Federal Reserve System and founder of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

In the 1950’s he started to explain the economy in terms of an inverted
pyramid. The basic idea of the liquidity pyramid was to convey the concept
of how easily an asset could be bought or sold. In other words – how
liquid it is. At the top, he placed the most risky, least liquid assets
and at the bottom, the least risky, most liquid assets.
Here, it might be helpful to consider the idea of ‘wealth.’ We do not really own anything; merely we have claims to ‘things.’ ‘Wealth’ is a claim to or a command of resources (land, labour, capital) that have the potential to make life ‘better’.

<h4>The central banks’ goals, in general, are threefold:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Expand the money supply allowing for the further proliferation of debt, which has sadly become the lifeline of most developed economies.</li>
  <li>Drive financial asset prices higher to create a wealth effect. This myth is premised on the belief that higher financial asset prices result in greater economic growth as wealth is spread to the masses.
    <ul>
      <li>“And higher stock prices will boost consumer wealth and help increase confidence, which can also spur spending. Increased spending will lead to higher incomes and profits that, in a virtuous circle, will further support economic expansion.”– Ben Bernanke Editorial Washington Post 11/4/2010.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lastly, generate inflation, to help lessen the burden of debt.</li>
<ul>

The wealth effect is putting riches in the hands of a small minority
of the population, with negligible benefits, if any, flowing to the
majority of the population. Bernanke’s version of the virtuous circle,
as highlighted above, is far from virtuous unless you are in the upper
five to ten percent of households by wealth.  To understand how a real
economic virtuous circle works, we recommend you read our article The
Death of the Virtuous Cycle and watch The Animated Virtuous Cycle.

<h4>Consider a few of these facts below and whether they are sustainable:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>U.S. yields have been among the lowest ever on record dating back to 1776</li>
  <li>U.S. equity valuations have risen to levels rarely observed and from this perch have always been followed by massive losses</li>
  <li>Over $9 trillion in sovereign bonds yields in many European countries and Japan have negative current yields</li>
  <li>European junk-grade debt now trades at yields lower than U.S. Treasuries</li>
  <li>Veolia, a French BBB rated company, recently issued a 3-year bond at a yield of -.026%.</li>
  <li>Italian 3-year government bonds yield -0.337%, despite the 3rd highest debt to GDP ratio of all developed nations (132%)</li>
  <li>Argentina, which has defaulted 6 times in the past 100 years, issued a $2.75 billion 100-year bond paying a paltry 8% interest</li>
  <li>The BOJ owns over 75% of all Japanese ETFs</li>
  <li>The Swiss National Bank owns 19.2 million shares of Apple, or 3% of total shares outstanding, and $84 billion in aggregate of U.S. stocks</li>
</ul>

Yes, Ron, the central bankers have clearly crossed the line between
free markets and government controlled markets. To answer your question
about the “shakeout,” we must wait until the inevitable day comes
and asset prices are in free-fall. When this occurs, we will learn the
full extent of their support and how far they have crossed the line

More than any other country, Switzerland’s ethos is centered around preparing for civilizational collapse.

Note the number of wells and fountains.

  On Being Wrong

Investors who strive to over-control, like the Yale students, are
doomed to failure, because they have committed themselves to a strategy
(performance chasing) that is empirically proven to limit returns. And
much research has shown that even perfect strategies experience large
drawdowns.

Indeed, our friends at Alpha Architect designed a “perfect portfolio.”
They “looked ahead” five years from portfolio formation and built
portfolios of large cap stocks poised to do the best. The performance
was amazing, but they also found something surprising, higher volatility
and similar drawdowns compared with the market as a whole.
