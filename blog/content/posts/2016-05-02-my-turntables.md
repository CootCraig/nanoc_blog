Technics SL-D93 w/ Audio-Technica DR400E - no needle

I just purchased a Technics SL-D93 with a Audio-Technica DR400E universal
mount cartridge installed.  There is no needle.  The SL-D93 manual states
that the arm uses a T4P P-mount.

What would you recommend to get this in play?

* needle for DR400E
* or new cartridge
* and good vendors to contact

# cartridges

A universal cartridge is simply a P-mount cartridge with a separate half-inch mount adaptor included. 

## Ortofon Concorde

One of my favorite cartridges to use on my SL-1200MK5 is the Ortofon
Concorde. I use the following styli with it: D25M for mono w/channels
summed, 20, 30, and 40. I'd recommend in particular the 30 stylus
which is a nude fine line design, an excellent performer at that price
point. Alignment with the Concorde is a snap, with nothing more than
tracking weight and antiskate to adjust.

The AT130E is another in our series featuring the para-toroidal coil
system.

Medium priced, it incorporates state of the art cartridge technologies,
including a magnetic circuit with centre shield, low mass dual magnet
stylus assembly using alinco magnets etc.

It offers unprecedented flat frequency response and outstanding sound
clarity and definition.

The body is made from a rigid high-density structure, which ensures that
the superior basic performance remains unaffected by harmful resonance

<ul>
  <li>Generating element: dual magnet</li>
  <li>Frequency response: 10 to 30,000Hz</li>
  <li>Output: 5.0mV</li>
  <li>Vertical tracking force: 0.8-1.8g</li>
  <li>Stylus shape: 0.2 x 0.7mil Biradial</li>
  <li>Stylus construction: nude</li>
  <li>Cantilever: tapered tube</li>
  <li>Weight: 6.2g</li>
  <li>Replacement stylus: ATN130E</li>
</ul>

What needles do you carry that would work with this turntable and cartridge?

What recommendations would you make?

subject: clumsy, destroyed the ATN3472SE stylus

I ordered ATN3472SE stylus to place on the AT DR400E cartridge that came on the Technics SL-D93 I purchased.  While installing the stylus I utterly destroyed it, completely my fault.  The next time around I will get a complete cartridge and be more careful.

FWIW I have 3 cartridges I use on a Technics style DD S arm turntable: Shure M55E, AT440MLa, Grado XT+.  At the moment the M55E is my favorite.  Perhaps I will try the Shure M92E to tet the SL-d93 in use.

Anyway, thanks for letting me vent, I'll likely get a T4P cartridge from you sometime soon.

Later,
Craig Anderson

No needles apparently.

recommended audio technica 311ep $65

Shure M92E for $60 would be a choice as well.

VMS 20E Mk II

This model, which was probably one of Ortofonâ€™s most highly acclaimed
magnetic cartridges, incorporates a nude, Elliptical diamond stylus. The
VMS 20E Mk II should have only be used with high quality turntables with
medium to low mass tonearms. Its fine tracking ability, low tracking force
and high output voltage brought out the best in any gramophone record.

<ul>
  <li>High quality VMS cartridge</li>
  <li>Patented Ortofon VMS technology</li>
  <li>Nude, Elliptical stylus</li>
  <li>0,50 mg effective stylus tip mass</li>

My picks, in order of preference.

<ol>
  <li>Audio Technica AT33EV</li>
  <li>Denon DL-103R</li>
  <li>Audio Technica AT-F7</li>
  <li>Denom DL-103</li>
</ul>

Note* The Denon DL-103 with a SoundSmith elliptical retip comes in
well under $500 and is a fine performer. The 103R with SS retip comes
in right at $500, maybe a bit less.
