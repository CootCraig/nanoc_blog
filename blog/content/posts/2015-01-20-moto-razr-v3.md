Subject: USB data/charge cable for Motorola RAZR V3?

I just purchased a Motorola RAZR V3 and found out that
a windows driver and special USB cable are required.
To be clear, I use Linux and want to make a USB
data connection from my Linux box.

I found this site with information.

I've seen Mckal listed as a possible source for these special cables.

Do you have such a cable?
