  Lucifer, the Light Bearer
</h4>
[Left of the Mast-Head] We date from the first of January, 1601. This era is call the Era of Man (E. M.) to distinguish it from the theological epoch that preceded it. In that epoch the earth was supposed to be flat, the Sun was its attendant Light revolving about it. Above was heaven where God reigned supreme over all potentates and powers; on earth ruled the Pope as the vice-general of God; below was the kingdom of the Devil, Hell. [?] taught the Bible. Then came the New Astronomy, the astronomy of Copernicus, Galileo and Bruno. It demonstrated that the earth is a globe revolving around the sun; that the stars are worlds and suns; that there is no "up" or "down" in space. Bruno sealed his devotion to the new truth with his life on 17th day of February, 1600. During the 17th century Grolius wrote the first work upon international law.

[Right of the Mast-Head] Our name, "Lucifer," comes to us from astronomy. Its etymology: Lus (Lucius, Light, and Ferre, to bring or bear. It was originally applied to the Morning Star. To [?] this illustrious name was bedimmed by theologians, see Webster's Dictionary, page [7?1] - note by Henderson. [?] also page 1621;

"Lucifer" 's in fact no profane or Satanic name. It is the Latin "Luciferus," the Light-bringer, the morning star, equivalent to the Greek "Phosphorus," and was a Christian name in early times, borne even by one of the Popes. It only acquired its present association from the apostrophe of the ruined king of Babylon, in Isaiah, as a fallen star.

As the night of theology wanes, and as the Daylight of Science advances[,] the grand old name will regain its pristine significance. Again will "Luciferus" be hailed "Son of the Morning!" "Herald of the Dawn!" "Harbinger of the Good Time[s] coming!"

  Sir Francis Galton - Later life - The eugenic vision
</h4>
Created term eugenics.

By 1873, Galton was further refining his ideas on eugenics, although
the term was still yet to be invented. He wrote a letter to The Times
headed Africa for the Chinese that expressed his racist philosophy in
uncompromising terms, proposing that the African continent was given
over lock, stock and barrel to the Chinese people: ‘the gain would be
immense’ if they were to ‘outbreed and finally displace’ the native
Africans. Furthermore, in the January 1873 edition of Fraser’s Magazine
he published a rambling fifteen page article – Hereditary improvement
– that set out in more detail than before his absurd and ghastly eugenic
‘Utopia’, where the genetic elite would be separated from the rest
of society and would be given all manner of incentives and bequests. The
genetic underclass would be expected to refrain from procreating otherwise
they would be regarded as ‘enemies of the State’, forfeiting ‘all
claims to kindness’. It is unclear what Galton means by these words,
but they have a terrifying resonance, knowing – as we do now – how
such policies were sanctioned in Nazi Germany only fifty years later.
