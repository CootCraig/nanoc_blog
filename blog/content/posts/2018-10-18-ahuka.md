Subject: I would like an epub of "LibreOffice Writer" page

Clear cold greetings from a seasoned, retired Linux guy.

First off, Kudos on the 4 letter domain name, ahuka.com, and the information you have provided

I have recently jumped head first into the rabbit hole of ebooks, ebook readers, and creating my own epub documents.  My planned workflow is:

Development in LibreOffice Writer with custom template
Finishing in Sigil

This brings me to ask, have you created an epub version of the LibreOffice Writer page?

If you have not, I will be sorely tempted to make one myself.

Later,

Craig Anderson

P.S. Note my 4 letter domain

  Background to the LibreOffice series

<h4>Workflow and Process</h4>

The starting point for me is research. Of course the 
<a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/documentation/" target="_blank">LibreOffice Documentation Site</a>
is important (there are very detailed guides for each
of the components), as is the 
<a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/Publications" target="_blank">Document Foundation Wiki</a>.
There is the
<a href="http://ask.libreoffice.org/en/questions/" target="_blank">Ask LibreOffice site</a>.
There is also an excellent mailing list called
<a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/mailing-lists/" target="_blank">Users</a>.
And I also look for articles on the Web. One person I pay close
attention to is Bruce Byfield, who is really an expert on LibreOffice,
and who is working on a book right now that will focus on Styles and
Templates. He writes for a number of publications, so the best way to find
his stuff is to follow him on Google+, or do a search on “Bruce Byfield
LibreOffice” to get plenty of articles. I will of course be buying his
book as soon as it comes out. When I find something that catches my eye,
I usually save it in Evernote, which I happen to like enough to get a
Pro account. And I want to mention a very detailed and excellent series
of articles in 
<a href="" target="_blank">Full Circle Magazine</a>
written by Elmer Perry. Full Circle
is a free electronic magazine you can download. I have written for them
before, and was initially considering doing something on LibreOffice,
but Elmer’s series is pretty darned good and I don’t know that I
could add enough to make it worthwhile.
