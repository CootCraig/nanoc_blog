  How to Plant Cottonwood Tree Seeds By Katelyn Lynn - 21 September, 2017
</h4>

The cottonwood tree is indigenous to North America, where it is commonly
seen growing along riverbanks and streams. It is easy to recognize in the
summer when the female cottonwood tree dispenses seeds attached to white
fiber type fluffs that resembles cotton. Planting cottowood tree seeds
is an easy process, but you must plant the seeds within two to three days
after you collect them. Otherwise the viability of the seeds can plummet.

Gather the seed capsules of a cottonwood tree before they dry and crack
open. This is usually in June or early July.

ce the cottonwood capsules into a fine-mesh wire colander or sieve. Put
the sieve or colander in a warm location in your home where it will
remain undisturbed. Let the capsules dry in the colander or sieve until
the capsules start to crack open. This can take as little as three or
four days or as long as a few weeks, depending on the temperature.

Rub the capsules across the surface of the colander or sieve to separate
the cottonwood tree seeds from the capsules. Do this once the capsules
have dried and are cracked open.

Fill up a seed flat or similar type of container with a good quality
seed-starting planting mix. Or if you want to make your own, measure
out equal amounts of vermiculite, perlite and peat moss. Mix the three
ingredients together until they are well blended. You can purchase a
seed flat at your local plant nursery or garden center.

Tamp down the seed raising mix in the tray using the base of a 4-inch
pot. Then, use the long side of 12-inch ruler to level off the contents
in the seed flat.

Create shallow rows, no more than 1/8 inch deep, in the seed flat. Each
row should be about 1 1/2 inches apart. Place one cottonwood tree seed
every 1 inch in each of the shallow rows. Then, press the cottonwood
tree seeds into the soil ensuring good seed-to-soil contact.

Transfer the seed tray into a light-filled temperate area in your
home. Placing the tray near a window that faces south, or southwest is
ideal. But do not place the tray where there will be any sunlight directly
upon it. The temperature range should be between 60 and 70 degrees F.

Mist the entire contents of the seed tray until it is thoroughly saturated
with water. Cottonwood tree seeds will typically being germinating within
a few hours, so it's essential the germinating media remains moist but
never sodden wet. You can transplant the cottonwood saplings into 4-inch
pots, or larger pots, when they are approximately 1 to 1 1/2 inches tall.

David Milarch, founder and president of the Champion Tree Project
David Milarch Champion Tree Project

The Champion Tree Project started in 1996 amid a similar round of
"nevers." At the time, Milarch was a tree farmer growing shade trees in
northern Michigan. His trees, like shade trees everywhere, were dying
off. At one point, his teenage son Jared asked why they didn't clone the
big old trees nearby — trees that have already lived through whatever
was killing the new shoots on the farm.

Milarch said he'd give it a try.

Cloning a tree is not especially technical. You take a cutting, generally
from a green tip, and graft it into the bark of another tree. Once the
graft sprouts roots, you plant in the ground.

Young trees are cloned like that all the time, Milarch said. But no one
had ever tried it with the biggest — and oldest — trees.

  Poplar (Populus spp.) Trees for Biofuel Production 
</h3>

In North America, eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides) and western
black cottonwood (P. trichocarpa) are two common poplar species (Fig
2). Eastern cottonwood (P. deltoides) has a wide distribution in the
eastern U.S. and Canada, and western black cottonwood (P. trichocarpa)
is found in the western U.S., Canada, and Alaska (Fig. 3).

The “cottonwood” species, as opposed to other poplars like the
aspens, have received the most attention for energy tree farms because
of their propensity to interbreed and their ability to reproduce from
dormant hardwood stem cuttings. These characteristics allow for rapid,
economical propagation and deployment of new, fast-growing hybrids. The
“cottonwood” poplars are bred as interspecies hybrids and managed as
clones. These clones can be used to establish hybrid poplar tree farms
in most of the U.S. where there is sufficient water. Research is also
being done to find hybrid varieties that grow well in the alkaline soils
of the arid and semi-arid regions of the intermountain West
