  Poplar (Populus spp.) Trees for Biofuel Production 
</h3>

In North America, eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides) and western
black cottonwood (P. trichocarpa) are two common poplar species (Fig
2). Eastern cottonwood (P. deltoides) has a wide distribution in the
eastern U.S. and Canada, and western black cottonwood (P. trichocarpa)
is found in the western U.S., Canada, and Alaska (Fig. 3).

The “cottonwood” species, as opposed to other poplars like the
aspens, have received the most attention for energy tree farms because
of their propensity to interbreed and their ability to reproduce from
dormant hardwood stem cuttings. These characteristics allow for rapid,
economical propagation and deployment of new, fast-growing hybrids. The
“cottonwood” poplars are bred as interspecies hybrids and managed as
clones. These clones can be used to establish hybrid poplar tree farms
in most of the U.S. where there is sufficient water. Research is also
being done to find hybrid varieties that grow well in the alkaline soils
of the arid and semi-arid regions of the intermountain West

Our company is located on the frontage road (United Ave) just East of
the Pueblo Airport.

If you want to use GPS to get to the right place use this address: 380
Lockheed Street, Pueblo, CO (Note this is not the actual address of our
building. This is the address that will get you to the back side of our
building which is where you need to go.)

If you go to the intersection of Lockheed St and United Ave, head North
on Lockheed and the location is at the end of Lockheed on the right,
you will cross a pair of two railroad tracks right together and then you
will cross a third set of railroad tracks, immediately after the third
set of tracks you will see the large pile of wood inside our fenced yard
