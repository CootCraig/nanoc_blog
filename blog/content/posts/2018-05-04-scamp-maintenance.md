<h4>Where is the serial number?</h4>

The serial number is located on the tongue of the trailer on the
door side of the trailer. It is stamped into the top of the 3" x 1 ½"
tubing. Most serial numbers will have 17 digits starting with "1S7". Some
older serial numbers will have 5 digits and start with an "E". There were
a few trailers made in the 70's where the serial number was stamped on
the top of the tongue opposite the door.

The built in Total Charge Management System (TCMS) connector allows
the RV manufacturer, dealer, or customer to easily add the optional
Charge Wizard. The Charge Wizard is a microprocessor-controller that
constantly monitors the RV battery voltage to determine if the battery
requires a quick recharge, is fully charged and being used, or is fully
charged and is in storage. The Charge Wizard then selects one of three
charging voltages: 14.4, 13.6, or 13.2; and one of four operating modes
(Boost, Normal, Storage or Desulfation) to properly re-charge or maintain
the battery.

</h2>

The Charge Wizard PD9105 (for Lead-Acid and AGM type Batteries) is also
available as a pendant. This allows easy field upgrade to your PD9100
series deck mount converter/charger by simply plugging the pendant
into the built-in TCMS® connector located just above the fuses on the
output panel. The Charge Wizard is a microprocessor-controlled unit that
constantly monitors the RV battery voltage and then selects one of three
charging voltages and one of four operating modes to properly re-charge
and maintain the RV battery. The addition of the Charge Wizard makes your
9100 Series converter an intelligent battery charger that will safely
and rapidly recharge a discharged battery by selecting the BOOST Mode
(14.4V) of operation.

Once the battery reaches 90% of full charge, the Charge
Wizardautomatically selects the NORMAL Mode (13.6V) to safely complete
the charge. The STORAGE Mode (13.2V) is automatically selected after 30
hours of non-use of the 12-volt RV electrical systems. The lower charging
voltage in the STORAGE Mode of operation reduces battery gassing and
water usage, while maintaining the charge. Every 21 hours when the system
is operating in the STORAGE Mode, the Charge Wizard will automatically
switch to the EQUALIZATION Mode of operation. The EQUALIZATION Mode
increases the charging voltage up to 14.4 volts for 15 minutes. This
increased voltage mixes up the battery electrolyte and prevents battery
stratification and the resulting problems of battery sulfation.

<h4>What is the Charge Wizard?</h4>

Our patented Charge Wizard 4-stage system uses microprocessor technology
to add intelligent charging capability. It constantly monitors the RV
battery and automatically adjusts the converter output voltage based on
the battery’s charge status – designed to eliminate battery over &
under charging problems associated with most other battery chargers and
provide rapid yet safe battery recharging after dry camping.

<h5>mounted in a 10.75"W x 7.25"H" cutout in a cabinet face</h5>

A superb all-in-one system for major electrical system overhauls
on trailers with 30 amp AC service. All major components are in one
integrated, central box.

The Progressive Dynamics Inteli-Power 4045 has nearly all the premium
features of our Progressive Dynamics 9245 45 amp converter PLUS an AC
breaker box for 30 amp service PLUS a DC fuse box all in one package. And
the price is truly astounding.

Save money and space by creating a combination AC/DC power center with
your AC breaker box, DC fuse box and power converter all pre-wired
together and all in one compact box. The panel is designed to be surface
mounted in a 10.75"W x 7.25"H" cutout in a cabinet face. To mount it
to a wall inside a cabinet you will need to build an interior mounting
surface that allows air to flow behind the unit.

NOTE: Breakers and 12-volt fuses are not included with the system,
but are commonly available through electrical supply companies and some
hardware stores. We carry compatible AC breakers and DC fuses.

<h5>Review By P. R.. Fectionist - Easy addition of vendor removed 120 volt hot buss feature.</h5>

Not:It turns out that Home Depot carries the SQUARE D product PK3GTA-1
Equipment Grounding Bar Kit, #51730

Progressive Dynamics used to brag about their "exclusive 120 volt hot
buss" feature. But then PD eliminated such a handy feature, stating in
their manual "Note: As of January 1, 2016, the hot buss in our model
PD4045 and PD4060 is no longer supplied by Progressive Dynamics as it
is not required for the proper function of the power center. If you
have any questions, please feel free to contact our Service Department
at 269-781-4242".

There is a solution for those like me that want the 120 volt hot buss
feature. It turns out that Home Depot carries the SQUARE D product
PK3GTA-1 Equipment Grounding Bar Kit, #51730. It is a 3-terminal bus
bar with a mounting hole. This bus bar exactly fits in the space still
provided in the sans hot bus products and its mounting hole and wire
access points also exactly match the PD mounting location. You will have
to provide your own about 1 inch long self tapping wood screw to mount
the buss bar as the kit's provided screw has machine threads.

Now there is again a handy location to secure the AC/DC converter's
black hot wire, rather than having it just hanging in space as the new
models are shipped. For a few bucks, you can upgrade the "NEW" no 120
volt hot buss PD units to again be full featured !! Then it's worthy
of 5-Stars rather than the 4-Stars I gave this review because of the
factory elimination of a feature that they used to brag about.

<h4>RV Battery Single Stage Converter Charger – The cause of short House Battery life and other problems.</h4>

The problem is that many factory-installed converters charge and maintain
batteries at a consistent voltage – usually 13.6V to 13.8V – which
is why they’re called ‘single stage’ converter/chargers. This
is a problem because batteries charge faster, last longer, and function
better when charged by a 3 or 4 stage ‘smart charger’. The four stages
– which I’ll cover below – are bulk (14.4V – 14.8V), absorption
(13.8V – 14.2V), float (13.2), and then periodic equalization charge
(15.5V) to ensure no battery sulfation  (a poor or reduced battery charge)
takes place.

When you maintain batteries at 13.7V they take forever to charge on
the front end if they fully charge at all, and then they get cooked
once the battery is charged. The charger literally boils off some of
the water in the batteries, which speeds up the sulfation process and
the batteries require more frequent maintenance – or die much faster
than they otherwise would.

I installed this

<h4>Jon in AZ</h4>

inside tire wear indicates a worn-out axle.

Because they don't get used a lot, trailer axles can sometimes age out
before they wear out (just like trailer tires). The rubber inside the
axle hardens over time and as Wayne says, loses resiliency. Clues include
excessive bouncing, cabinets popping open, cushions on the floor... The
test is pretty simple. Raise one side of the trailer by jacking on the
frame just behind the wheel (never on the axle itself). The wheel should
drop down several inches as the trailer rises and the rubber suspension
relaxes. If you want you can measure the distance between the hub and
the top of the wheel well arch before and after jacking. Little or no
movement indicates an aged out axle.

Torsion axles will also tend to sag over time, giving the trailers a
"low rider" look, but that does not necessarily indicate the axle is bad
(unless it gets to the point something is rubbing). Scamp recommends
storing the trailer up on jack stands to help preserve the factory ride
height. Something to consider after you replace the axle.

Normal lifespan of a rubber torsion axle is considered to be around 15-20
years, but it's common for many to remain in service well beyond that,
with gradually decreasing ride quality. As long as nothing is rubbing
with a few inches of clearance in the wheel wells, it's safe to pull,
but it's hard on the shell and everything in it to continue running on
an axle that has lost its resiliency.

Here's a good video showing how rubber torsion axles work.
