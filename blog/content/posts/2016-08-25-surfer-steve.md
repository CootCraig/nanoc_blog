If new to surfing, ride mostly small, or slow waves, or just enjoy early
wave entry gliding, use the following  guidelines: 1/2" thickness for
each 25 lb. of body wt. and 2' longer than height.  To be more exact
use:  .50 cubic feet of foam per 25 lb. of body weight (the US Blanks,
and Clark Foam catalog has the cubic foot numbers for each blank for
free online at www.foamez.com ). For example;  a 150lb. surfer divided
by 25 equals 6.  6 times .50  = 3 cubic feet of foam.  Add at least 5%
(1/4") for shaping losses which brings the example to  3.15 cubic feet.
Simply look at the displacement number (cubic feet of foam) in the
catalog for the blank with a close number.  If you pick a blank within
10% of your number you will have a good wave catcher.    Remember to
add 10 lbs to your weight if you wear a wetsuit often when surfing.
These guidelines are maximums.  More is not likely better in this case.
A board designed using the math above gives a huge advantage in crowded
conditions, by allowing early wave entry.
