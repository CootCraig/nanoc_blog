## strapworks

My name is Thomas Foster. My wife Donna, my son Douglas, and I
own Strapworks.com. Here is a little background on the "History of
Strapworks.com".

In 1976, I started making cam straps for myself and a few boating
friends. When other boaters saw our fancy straps (versus their ropes and
spring buckle straps), they just had to know where to buy some. Strapworks
was born out of that simple formula. Although our first straps were all
black, I really wanted to have some color involved. And, I was really
tired of arguing over which straps in the pile were mine. So, I found
some yellow webbing and separated myself from the herd. Of course, the
color idea snowballed. Literally for years, Strapworks was the only strap
manufacturer using any colored webbing. Our strap business prospered. We
started the idea of color coding different lengths of straps for easy
identification. After a few years, other suppliers saw our success and
started offering colored straps. But it was a weak attempt. They would
offer only a few colors and only in set lengths.
