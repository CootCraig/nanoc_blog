Stand up paddleboarding is the latest rage because it is easy and it
is fun! The Voyager kit is for a 14' hollow wooden stand up paddleboard
built using stitch and glue techniques. For more information on the build
process please go to our SUP Blog.  This board features a V entry to cut
the chop and glide smoothly through the water, the bottom transitions
from the V at the bow to flat through the tail of the board making it
stable underfoot.  The hard chine rails and removable fin track nicely
through the water making the board a pleasure to paddle.  Build time is
estimated to be between 35-60 hours depending on your skill level and
level of finish desired.

Stand up paddle boards make a great first time boat building project
because the insides don't need to be finished and they don't have a lot
of parts like hatches and coamings that really add to the time it takes
to finish a project.  The Voyager SUP is designed to be a great first
time boat building or board building project.
