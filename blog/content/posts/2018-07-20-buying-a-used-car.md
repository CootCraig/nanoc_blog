Check craigslist 3 times a day. Should be first.


Reject ad that hides the license plate. broker or curbstoner.

<b>Determining the cars Value</b>

There are two valuation guides that you should be using. Most people tend to know about Kelly Blue Book
(<a target="_blank" href="http://www.kbb.com/">kbb.com</a>).
KBB is “dealer biased” which is the highest valuation. Dealers use it to justify higher prices on their lots.

For a “consumer biased” valuation site go to 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.edmunds.com/">edmunds.com</a>.
At Edmunds you will find a pricing structure that is based on a more
realistic street value. You will want to look at both Kelly Blue Book
and Edmunds to get a real world look at what you should be paying.
If the dealer uses the higher KBB price, be sure to bring your Edmunds
printout so you will have negotiating leverage.<
