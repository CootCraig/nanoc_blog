Jay's assembly model with cutlist layout

I sized the router guides to have 3” of distance from the fence to
the zero clearance line. That should be enough for most routers using a
1-2” router bit. With a 1/2” bit installed in my router the distance
from the edge of the bit to the end of the base plate is 2-3/4” so I
needed to cut a new zero clearance edge on both guides.

The fences will be below the router guides and the front fence needs to
be perpendicular to the stationary guide. That way only one reference
mark is needed on the work piece to establish the location. Wood glue
and brads will hold it in place.

The second fence doesn’t necessarily need to be perpendicular. It just
needs to allow enough room for the floating guide to move freely. Again,
wood glue and brads to hold it while the glue dries.

Jay - I used hardware that I already had on hand which was 5/16” x
3-1/2” carriage bolts and matching t-nuts. You could probably get away
with a smaller diameter bolt and wing nut.

To set the width of the dado insert the material that will be going
into the dado into the jig. Adjust the floating guide to sandwich the
material. And tighten down the hold down blocks.
