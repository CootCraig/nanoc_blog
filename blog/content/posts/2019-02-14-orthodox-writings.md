<h4>The Apostolic Fathers - Fr. Josiah</h4>

Patristic Nectar Publications is pleased to present a five-part lecture
series by Father Josiah Trenham entitled THE APOSTOLIC FATHERS. This
collection of the earliest post-New Testament Christian literature is
replete with inspiring examples of Christian devotion and provides a
valuable window into both the significant personalities and the spiritual
and theological ethos of the Christian generations immediately following
the Apostolic period. These texts are also of great apologetic value in
the contemporary pluralistic milieu in which Orthodox Christians dwell
in the West. The lecture titles are as follows:

<pre>
Lecture #1 The Epistle of St. Clement of Rome to the Corinthians
Lecture #2 The Letters of St. Ignatius of Antioch
Lecture #3 The Epistle and Martyrdom of St. Polycarp of Smyrna
Lecture #4 The Epistle of Barnabas and the Didache
Lecture #5 The Epistle to Diognetus and the Shepherd of Hermas
All 5 Lectures: $15.00

  Apostolic Fathers
</h3>

The term Apostolic Fathers refers both to a group of early Christian
writers (the first among the Church Fathers) and to a particular
collection of their writings. These writings comprise the first known
Christian writings after the composition of the New Testament, and some
were even considered for inclusion in the canon (i.e., the epistles of
St. Clement of Rome).

The most common lists of these writings usually include most or all of
the following:

<pre>
The Epistle to Diognetus
The First Epistle of Clement
The Second Epistle of Clement
The Didache
The Epistle of Barnabas
Seven short Epistles of Ignatius of Antioch (the longer forms of these Epistles, and those beyond the seven, are widely considered later emendations and forgeries)
The Epistle of Polycarp
The Martyrdom of Polycarp
The Shepherd of Hermas
</pre>
