  Colorado opens door to online education

Colorado has cracked open the door to multi-district online learning a
little wider.

The Colorado State Board of Education approved certification for two
schools at its June meeting at Pueblo Community College, at the same
meeting where it recognized three teachers and a counselor for excellence
in blended and online education.

Parents and students can now go to enrollinschool.com to make initial
contact for the tuition-free, multi-district programs.

AIM Global — AIM stands for achievement, innovation, mastery —
is a school for at-risk kids in grades 6–12 who have struggled in
traditional schools. Immersion School for Sciences, Technology and the
Arts is a college prep school for students who need academic enrichment.

The schools are a cooperative venture between Summit Education Group,
which will run them, and the Las Animas School District in southeastern
Colorado. Funding will come from state per pupil money, with 10 percent
going to the school district and 90 percent to SEG.

Las Animas Superintendent Elsie Goines was the authorizer on the
application for certification. She said that the number one benefit,
and the number one reason the district engaged with SEG, was that
the district’s own students will benefit in that they’ll have
opportunities they wouldn’t have otherwise...

“We’re always looking at how can we share resources and be more
effective with the resources we have,” Goines said.

The biggest concern she had before getting on board with online learning
was accountability, and that it will deliver a quality education for
students. “We’re making sure we’re going into this with eyes wide
open and that it’s going to do the things we say it’s going to do.”

She added that she’ll be looking for transparency and accountability.

Online and  blended education have had their share of critics, including
some from within the charter school movement.

A recent report from the National Alliance of Public Charter Schools
concluded that virtual school students perform worse on academics than
traditional school students. The NAPCS  and National Association of
Charter School Authorizers have recommended performance-based funding
and shutting down low-performing schools.

As of August 2014 there were 135 virtual charter schools serving about
180,000 students in 23 states and the District of Columbia.

Larry Kerr, director of communications for SEG, said that as many as
1,000 students from different Colorado school districts might enroll in
the Las Animas project, which will feature a combination of working online
and face-to-face with teachers certified in the four core content areas,
and interacting with life enrichment coaches.

The coaches will reach out to students once a day and help them with
social-emotional issues. They’ll also provide “wrap-around services”
as needed, such as providing food, bus passes, and even diapers for
babies of students who are teen parents.

The coaches will also help advanced students enroll in college courses.

“We do what we call concurrent enrollment, because we have relationships
with all the community colleges, and Summit pays for the courses,”
Kerr said.

If it works, expect SEG to take their show on the road.

“We’ve had a great deal of interest from other states,” Kerr
said, “and we really want to duplicate this model, but we want to get
everything set in Colorado first.”
