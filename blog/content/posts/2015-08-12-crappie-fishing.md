No such thing as best/worst time of the day. They eat 24 hrs a day. You
just have to be in the right place at the right time and give them what
THEY want. That is part of the fun in figuring out what that is. On
a new lake I start with a plain minnow and find the depth the Crappie
are at, with this you can see how aggressive they are, and then pick a
jig to match their mood, whether aggressive or not. Drop your jig and
see how far you can see your jig before you lose sight of it, and that
will tell you how stained the water is. Clear water use bright colors
and stain water use darker colors. Then that will cut down on colors to
use. Depending on how aggressive they are determines the size of jig
head to use 1/32, 1/16, or 1/8th. This determines the rate of fall or
how long it takes the jig to get down to a specific depth, hopefully
where the Crappie are. Once you get the jig head and color figured out
to where you start catching Crappie notice how they are taking the jig
in. If you are just catching them in the lip that will work but you
don't have what they really want as far as color. This is the time to
experiment with the color a bit. When you have what they really want
they will suck the jig way down. This is when it gets fun and you load
the boat with Crappie. You will be catching them on every cast.

In your situation I would have stayed out a ways and cast up to the weeds
and let the jig slow fall through them. If I didn't have a response after
a few cast I would use a bobber and set it to just above them or at the
level they were at. If that didn't work I would try a minnow and if that
didn't work, I would move and try to find a more aggressive bunch. If
a lot of people were trying to catch them it will shut them off from
biting for awhile. EB

I prefer daylight best due to the heat (on me). Rarely will I fish longer
than noon i this heat. By that time I've had enough, even though alot
of times I'll leave fish biting. Fish are usually caught shallower in
the water column earlier then they start migrating into deeper water as
the sun gets high. Our water temps now is 80+ degrees at daylight and
I'll fish generally 8'-17' of water and the better bites on most days
are at 6'-9' deep. Rely on your graph to show you where theyre holding
and present your baits right above the fish if possible.

I pull out a #4 Glass Shad Rap and start probing basins just outside
backwater spawning areas. Most of these basins run 3 to 4 to 7 feet
deep. The Shad Rap runs 3 to 4 feet down on 6-pound Sufix 832, a braid,
depending how high I keep my rod tip. I’m just casting, making slow
retrieves, and covering water looking for fish. I start seeing some
fish on the locator and finally catch a big fish, maybe 2.5 pounds. Then
another nice one. And another.

Many anglers hesitate to use cranks because compared to a typical crappie
jig they seem too big—even immense. But I open the mouth of a 2-pounder
that has completely eaten the Shad Rap. This fish could eat 4 Shad Raps
at the same time. A 3-pound fish could eat a baseball.

It isn’t just diving cranks that do a job on crappies in certain
situations. The key factor in deciding on a crankbait style is
always first, where are the fish. How deep are they? Depth control
is paramount. Speed control and the way you’re working the lure is
secondary, but also vital. All the other factors—lure size, color,
profile, vibration pattern, and so on—you tinker with after the first
two factors are in check. I agree, however, that lures for crappies
shouldn’t be too big. I also agree there are traditionally productive
colors crappies like in various water-clarity situations.

I think the vibration pattern of a lure is more important than the
other factors most of the time. Depth, speed and how you’re working
the lure, then vibration pattern—before considering size, shape,
color. The problem is that vibration pattern is dependent on the lure
style you choose, so it’s hard to factor it in, other than as a matter
of switching crankbait styles.
