I found out I had corrupted my git install so I reinstalled from git and always run from the command line now.
I still have not been able to get GPODDER_DOWNLOAD_DIR to have an effect.
What I want to leave GPODDER_HOME and change GPODDER_DOWNLOAD_DIR to a network folder.

When GPODDER_HOME and GPODDER_DOWNLOAD_DIR are not set:

The database is found.
ls ~/gPodder

These lines were in my ~/.bashrc file, not done interactively at the shell:

declare -x GPODDER_DOWNLOAD_DIR="/media/sf_r1/audio/gpodder"
declare -x GPODDER_HOME="/media/sf_r1/audio/gpodder"

I'm afraid I'm being all muddled.

What I added to my ~/.bashrc file:
> In ~/.bashrc
> export GPODDER_HOME=/media/sf_r1/audio/gpodder
> export GPODDER_DOWNLOAD_DIR=/media/sf_r1/audio/gpodder

Output of export before I start gpodder from the command line:
> $ export
> declare -x GPODDER_DOWNLOAD_DIR="/media/sf_r1/audio/gpodder"
> declare -x GPODDER_HOME="/media/sf_r1/audio/gpodder"

I reinstalled gpodder, tested and it works as expected.

1) Set GPODDER_DOWNLOAD_DIR in ~/.bashrc
2) Install gpodder from git.
3) Run from command line.
3) Subscribe to https://peterboyles.podbean.com/
4) Download the last 8 episodes
5) It all worked.

1) Set GPODDER_DOWNLOAD_DIR in ~/.bashrc
cat ~/.bashrc
...
alias gpodder=$HOME/gpodder/bin/gpodder
export GPODDER_DOWNLOAD_DIR=/media/sf_r1/audio/gpodder-downloads

2) Install gpodder from git.
git clone https://github.com/gpodder/gpodder.git
cd gpodder
python3 tools/localdepends.py         # To install dependencies

3) Run from command line. (See alias above)
gpodder

3) Subscribe to https://peterboyles.podbean.com/

4) Download the last 8 episodes

5) It all worked.
ls -R /media/sf_r1/audio/gpodder-downloads
/media/sf_r1/audio/gpodder-downloads:
'The Peter Boyles Show'

Is it possible to connect to iHeartRadio podcasts with gpodder?
example URL is
https://www.iheart.com/podcast/the-ross-kaminsky-show-20710514/

I do not use an Android or an Iphone smart phone.

It seems when I delete a podcast download it is removed from the episode list.  I would like to delete the local copy and have the episode remain in the episode list.  Is this possible?

Yes. Thanks.
So have I missed a manual that I should have consulted?
