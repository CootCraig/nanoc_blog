In the case of Ruby git,rbenv and bundler are the keys to project
management.  Looking for the Python keys.  Looking at git, pyenv,
virtualenv.

Simple Python Version Management: pyenv

pyenv lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python. It's
simple, unobtrusive, and follows the UNIX tradition of single-purpose
tools that do one thing well.

This project was forked from rbenv and ruby-build, and modified for
Python.

Jamie Matthews - A non-magical introduction to Pip and Virtualenv for Python beginners

One of the hurdles that new Python developers have to get over is
understanding the Python packaging ecosystem. This blog post is based
on material covered in our Python for Programmers training course,
which attempts to explain pip and virtualenv for new Python users.

#### How does virtualenv help?

virtualenv solves this problem by creating a completely isolated
virtual environment for each of your programs. An environment is simply
a directory that contains a complete copy of everything needed to run
a Python program, including a copy of the python binary itself, a copy
of the entire Python standard library, a copy of the pip installer, and
(crucially) a copy of the site-packages directory mentioned above. When
you install a package from PyPI using the copy of pip that's created by
the virtualenv tool, it will install the package into the site-packages
directory inside the virtualenv directory. You can then use it in your
program just as before.

#### How can I install virtualenv?

In fact, virtualenv comes with a copy of pip which gets copied into every
new environment you create, so virtualenv is really all you need. You
can even install it as a separate standalone package (rather than from
PyPI). This might be easier for Windows users. See virtualenv.org for
instructions.

# pyenv / virtualenv try 1

## Show python versions on system

<pre>
python --version
Python 2.7.9

which python
/usr/bin/python

python3 --version
Python 3.4.2

which python3
/usr/bin/python3
</pre>

## run pyenv-installer

<pre>
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yyuu/pyenv-installer/master/bin/pyenv-installer | bash
 ...
Cloning into '/home/craig/.pyenv'...

WARNING: seems you still have not added 'pyenv' to the load path.

 Load pyenv automatically by adding
 the following to ~/.zshrc:

export PATH="/home/craig/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
 ...
</pre>

## Install local pythons

<pre>
pyenv install --list
 ...
  2.7.12
 ...
  3.5.2
 ...

pyenv install 2.7.12

pyenv install 3.5.2

### Python's bz2 module not compiled by default

Python's bz2 module not compiled by default

<pre>
option 2. build and install bzip2

In the README file of bzip2 package, it is explained that under certain platforms, namely those which employ Linux-ELF binaries, you have to build an additional shared object file like shown below:

wget http://bzip.org/1.0.6/bzip2-1.0.6.tar.gz
tar xpzf bzip2-1.0.6.tar.gz
cd bzip2-1.0.6
make
make -f Makefile-libbz2_so
make install PREFIX=/path/to/local # /usr/local by default

The critical bit here is the following command:

make -f Makefile-libbz2_so

I've done this and after that tried to build Python again, like shown below:

cd Python-2.7.3
./configure --prefix=/path/to/local 
make install
</pre>

### Build bzip2 from source

<a href="http://bzip.org/" target="_blank">bzip.org</a>

Here is the 
<a href="http://bzip.org/1.0.6/bzip2-1.0.6.tar.gz" target="_blank">1.0.6 source tarball</a>
, which includes full documentation.
md5: 00b516f4704d4a7cb50a1d97e6e8e15b

<pre>
make
 ...
make distclean # tests are successful.
 ...
make -f Makefile-libbz2_so
 ...
sudo checkinstall
 ...
 Done. The new package has been installed and saved to

 /home/craig/dev/bzip2/bzip2-1.0.6/bzip2_1.0.6-1_amd64.deb

 You can remove it from your system anytime using: 

      dpkg -r bzip2
</pre>

### Install pythons again

<pre>
cd /home/craig/.pyenv/versions
rm -rf 2.7.12 3.5.2

pyenv install 2.7.12
