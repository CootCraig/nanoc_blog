</h2>

Hi, my name is Sam Williamson. I’m the founding director of  Beliefs of
the Heart, author Hearing God in Conversation: How to Recognize His Voice
Everywhere  and of Is Sunday School Destroying Our Kids? How Moralism
Suffocates Grace.

<h4>What’s So Different about This Plan?</h4>

My various failures brought clarity. I realized I wanted a plan that
(a) allowed me to go at my own pace; (b) covered all of Scripture
(eventually); (c) intermingled the Old Testament genres of story,
poetry, and prophets; and (d) was designed to engage God through biblical
meditation.

Each day’s reading fuses together passages from the Psalms, Old
Testament, New Testament narratives, and New Testament letters. The
Old Testament books are reshuffled so that Isaiah isn’t followed by
a dozen more prophets.

You read at your own pace. Some days you may read a few verses from each
section; other days, a whole chapter. If you miss a day (or a week),
you pick up where you left off—no need to play catch-up. A typical
day averages fifteen minutes of reading. But there is no typical day.

I promise you this: You’ll never fall behind; I won’t ask you the name
of Balaam’s donkey; and the book of Hebrews will no longer intimidate
you. And I’m pretty sure you’ll love it as I do.
