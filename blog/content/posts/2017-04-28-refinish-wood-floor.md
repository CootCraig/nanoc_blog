Bona based in Malmö Sweden

The industry's premium waterborne, commercial and residential hardwood
floor finish for durability and beauty.

Designed specifically for the unique demands of heavy traffic commercial
and residential hardwood floors. Advanced formula provides the ultimate
in durability, outperforming any finish in the industry - moisture cure,
solvent-based, oil-modified or other waterborne finishes. GREENGUARD

<h3>Bona Restore - Recoat System </h3>

Restore for a longer floor lifetime. Your customers work hard to ensure
their hardwood floors look beautiful, but over time, the finish is
slowly removed by the friction of daily foot traffic in the home. If
the necessary steps to properly maintain them are not met, eventually
bare wood will be exposed requiring a complete refinish. Every few years
floors can be recoated to maintain their protective layer with the Bona
Recoat System. This proved recoat process safely removes contaminants
from the floor, rinses the floor clean and refortifies the hardwood floor
with a new coat of Bona Traffic or Bona Traffic HD. In less than a day
your customers can have a new coat of finish that restores the beauty
and prolongs the life of their hardwood floor.

<h1>Waterlox on wood flooring</h1>

Chemically speaking, our Waterlox Original Tung Oil products are
resin-modified tung oil based wood finishes. The tung oil provides the
best penetrating and drying qualities available while the resin allows
the coatings to form a film that is both water-resistant and elastic
– standing up to both foot traffic and common household spills.

Different from other types of wood finishes, Waterlox offers “best
of both worlds” benefits. For example, raw oils penetrate into wood
but do not provide any real protection to the substrate. Plus, raw oil
finishes need to be recoated often. Urethane coatings lay on top of
the surface, look more like plastic, can be brittle and once breached
ultimately fail. Waterlox is truly incomparable because it penetrates
like raw oil, while protecting and nurturing the wood without becoming
fragile or having a plastic appearance

Waterlox finishes penetrate into the pores of the wood and build up
to a coating that both guards and strengthens the wood. Best of all,
they are easier to restore and re-coat. And without tung oil, Waterlox
extraordinary finishes wouldn’t be possible.

  Should You Refinish Hardwood Floors Yourself?
</h4>

Even if the cost of hiring a pro ($4 to $5 per square foot) makes you
sweat, don’t consider taking on the job yourself without an (ahem)
honest evaluation of your own skills. (Do you really want to put your
home value on the line to learn a new skill?)

Recoat vs. refinish.

Screen and recoat

  What is a screen and recoat? What does buffing mean?
</h4>

Screening and buffing are the same thing. They are synonyms for each
other, and both mean that you “scuff up” or abrade the floor, and then
you apply a coat of polyurethane for protection and sheen.  Screening
is often called buffing, since the screening is done with a buffer.
Screening both smooths the floors a bit, and the abrasive action allows
the polyurethane to adhere to the surface better.  The screen and recoat
process can restore the glow of the floors and give them a refreshed look.

  What the heck is a screen and recoat?
</h4>

A screen and recoat is the best-kept secret in the hardwood flooring
world.

But it shouldn't be, because it can save you money, labor and time over
the life of your hardwood floor. Read on, and remember, the buffer is
your friend.

If you have spent any time talking to your hardwood flooring professional
(or reading the hardwood flooring blogs) you’ve heard the phrase
“screen and recoat.” Here at Pete’s we know that people can toss
around jargon like that in an attempt to sound knowledgeable, but in this
case, the jargon actually means something.  Also known as "buff and coat"

The phrase “screen and recoat­” describes the process of sprucing
up an existing coat of polyurethane by top-coating it. (This is sometimes
referred to as "buff and coat" because the screen is often driven across
the floor by a buffer). But the inclusion of the word ‘screen’ is
vital because in order to get a new coat to adhere to the old one you
must lightly sand or ‘screen’ it.

100 grit sanding screen A screen is just a mesh encrusted with abrasive
particles. Because it is a mesh, there are fewer abrasive particles
per square inch, making it generally less aggressive than sandpaper
(a 120-grit sanding screen, for example, will be less aggressive than
120-grit sandpaper.)

Screens are also used under thick soft pads that further soften the
cutting action of the screen. This is desirable because floor screening
should only leave enough texture in the floor to allow a new coat of
polyurethane to bond; screening should remove only a tiny fraction of
the existing finish.  Part of a regular maintenance program

That was a long-winded explanation that only just hinted at the purpose
of a screen and recoat. It is simply part of the regular maintenance of
a hardwood floor that has been finished by polyurethane. Polyurethane
is considered a protective sacrificial coat. Over time, the plastic in
the finish is slowly removed by the friction of day-to-day living.

That layer gets thinner and more scratched each year—as it
should—because its job is to keep damage away from the wood
below. But if you let that protective coat deteriorate for too long,
it will eventually expose bare wood to assaults from doggy toenails,
coffee spills and baby drool, causing damage that can only be repaired
by sanding the whole floor. This, you do not want.

So, every few years, well before the protective coat has grown too thin,
you refresh it with another coat. The crucial word is “before;”
you have to recoat a floor before you see damage, which is hard for
some people because they think they’re leaving money on the table by
top-coating what appears to be a perfectly good floor finish.

But polyurethane on floors is kind of like sunscreen on skin: not only do
you need to put on a good thick layer before you expose it to the sun;
you must re-apply it periodically because it wears off. Once sunburn
begins to appear, it is too late to start applying protection. Protection
is always less costly than the damage that results from not having it.
