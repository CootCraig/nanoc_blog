Guerrilla guide to CNC machining, mold making, and resin casting


<a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/gcnc/ch4/" target="_blank">4. Resin casting and you</a>

Poor choice of working materials is one of the most common mistakes made
by hobbyist machinists; quite a few people stick to workpieces that
offer poor accuracy, get damaged easily, gum up the tool, or simply
cost way too much. For moldmaking purposes, your best bet is one of
the little-known materials: an extremely accurate, low cost piece of
plastic known as a medium-density modelling board, originally devised
for the automotive industry. It's essentially a mix of medium strength
polyurethane, and a combination of soft fillers such as calcium carbonate
and aluminum hydroxide. There are many types of machinable boards, but
the one we are interested in has a density of about 0.70-0.78 g/cmÂ³,
and vaguely resembles wood:

Prototyping boards of this particular variety include Huntsman RenShape
460 (or sligthly less dense BM 5460), Axson ProLab 65, Sika SikaBlock
M700, BCC MB2001, Necuron Necumer 651, and several more. The material
is typically sold in bulk, in sheets of about 50 x 150 cm, 25 mm
thick. This may sound like a lot, but I recommend buying a full board,
rather than grossly overpriced cut-to-size bits. The material lasts me
for about a year, and costs about $12 per liter (roughly $250 for the
whole thing). It's much less than what you'd pay for a similar slab of
HDPE or acrylic - and it machines easier, too. (Planks of dense hard
wood, when glued together and planed, may be a cheaper alternative for
uncomplicated parts.)

Buying prototyping boards is actually pretty easy. If you are in the US,
you can simply go to Freeman Supply, and order RenShape 460 online (search
for item #075229). In other places, simply look at the manufacturers'
websites and find local distributors, then send out several e-mails or
make some calls (online ordering isn't common in the industrial world). Be
aware that prices may vary significantly, so shop around.
