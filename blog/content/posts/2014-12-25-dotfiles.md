# Using justone/dotfile

<a href="https://github.com/justone/dotfiles" target="_blank">github.com/justone/dotfiles</a>

## Restart to handle changes better

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Clone the justone master:
git clone git@github.com:justone/dotfiles.git df
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
rename origin to upstream
git remote rename origin upstream
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create repo df at github
git remote add origin git@github.com:CootCraig/df.git
git push -u origin master
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create a new user to develop with

# Old Notes Follow

This repo is a skeleton/template repo for tracking dotfiles. It contains
a utility (dfm) to help with managing and updating your dotfiles.



## Notes as of Tue Dec 30 10:42:28 MST 2014

### started with fork of https://github.com/justone/dotfiles

### dotfile folders with no secrets

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just import dotfile folders with no secrets.
cd ~/dotfiles
bin/dfm import .gitconfig
bin/dfm import .i3
bin/dfm import .vim
bin/dfm import .vimrc
 ...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### dot files/folders with secrets

Make a list of them.

#### .icedove

#### .remmina

#### .weechat

List them in ~/dotfiles/.gitignore

Arrange to copy them into ~/dotfiles
before running dfm install

## Essential programs and dotfile candidates

* build-essential checkinstall
* git
* gitlab - private gitlab servers
* hosts - /etc/host for GCS windows host names
* i3 - tiled window manager
* java runtime
* lightdm - x login manager and x.org seed package
* music on console
* remmina - rdp client
* passworddragon
* reptyr - A tool for "re-ptying" programs
* st - suckless simple terminal
* supervisord - programs for boot time: mocp,weecat
* tmux
* vim
* weechat
* zsh

## Personal Debian package installs

* vim tmux git
* build-essential checkinstall libtool automake uuid-dev
* cifs-utils winbind
* supervisord

## Solarized color scheme

### Using Solarized in Vim


### terminator using solarized

#### [github.com/ghuntley](https://github.com/ghuntley/terminator-solarized) terminator-solarized

A color theme for terminator using Ethan Schoonoverâ€™s Solarized color scheme.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Usage
Install the terminiator configuration file:

mkdir -p ~/.config/terminator/
cp config ~/.config/terminator/
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### terminator over ssh using solarized

http://superuser.com/questions/370556/vim-colors-not-working-properly-in-terminal


vim use the power of your "terminal" to draw the characters onto
the screen. thus, how the drawn chars look depend largely on what the
"terminal" is capable of. the "terminal" uses an enviroment variable to
tell the apps running inside it about its capabilities: TERM.

if you want to use vim to use 256 colors you need 2 things:

* a terminal capable of rendering at least 256 colors
* the right TERM variable (xterm-256color)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
so, try this:
export TERM=xterm-256color
vim
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Use ccrypt to encrypt secrets

* [ccrypt at sourceforge](http://ccrypt.sourceforge.net/)

There is a deb file available there.

### Consider these people

* qbit
* Zach Holman - like his subfolder organization
* Bobby Russel - master of oh-my-zsh - Zach recommended
* Nate Jones - justone - dotfiles - dfm
* xero - uses stow - uses subfolders

#### What about dfm?

* [Dfm - a Utility to Manage Dotfiles](http://endot.org/2010/10/16/dfm-a-utility-to-manage-dotfiles/)

##### [github.com - justone/dotfiles](https://github.com/justone/dotfiles)

This repo is a skeleton/template repo for tracking dotfiles. It contains
a utility (dfm) to help with managing and updating your dotfiles.


### Where to start

* Zach Holman - like his subfolder organization
* Ryan Bates - bash,vim,zsh,rails - Zach recommended
* Bobby Russel - master of oh-my-zsh - Zach recommended
* Ryan Tomayko - great documentation - many forks - Zach recommended


### People / dotfiles to study

* [qbit](https://github.com/qbit/dotfiles)
* [Your unofficial guide to dotfiles on GitHub.](http://dotfiles.github.io/)
* [xero/dotfiles](https://github.com/xero/dotfiles)
* [Zach Holman - Dotfiles Are Meant to Be Forked](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/)
* [Zach Holman - holman does dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)

So, organize it. Do what programmers have been doing for years: make a
smart system, follow it, and let others use it too.

There's a lot of great projects doing this:

##### Ryan Bates (@rbates)

Ryan Bates (@rbates) fame has his own network of 175 forks. His project
centers around bash and zsh, TextMate, Vim, and Rails.

* [ryanb/dotfiles](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles)

##### Robby Russell (@robbyrussell)

Robby Russell (@robbyrussell) started up oh-my-zsh, a community of some
250 forks surrounding zsh.

* [robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

##### Ryan Tomayko (@rtomayko)

Ryan Tomayko (@rtomayko) open sourced his dotfiles with a great set of
documentation and some 150 developers watching the repository.

* [rtomayko/dotfiles](https://github.com/rtomayko/dotfiles)

##### sheerun

* [sheerun - This dotfiles are meant to be used with zsh](https://github.com/sheerun/dotfiles)

### tools

#### gnu stow

* [GNU Stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)

GNU Stow is a symlink farm manager which takes distinct packages of
software and/or data located in separate directories on the filesystem,
and makes them appear to be installed in the same place. For
example, /usr/local/bin could contain symlinks to files within
/usr/local/stow/emacs/bin, /usr/local/stow/perl/bin etc., and likewise
recursively for any other subdirectories such as .../share, .../man,
and so on.

This is particularly useful for keeping track of system-wide and per-user
installations of software built from source, but can also facilitate a
more controlled approach to management of configuration files in the
user's home directory, especially when coupled with version control
systems.
