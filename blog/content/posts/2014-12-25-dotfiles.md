## Research

### People / dotfiles to study

#### [Zach Holman - Dotfiles Are Meant to Be Forked](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/)

So, organize it. Do what programmers have been doing for years: make a
smart system, follow it, and let others use it too.

There's a lot of great projects doing this:

##### Ryan Bates (@rbates)

Ryan Bates (@rbates) fame has his own network of 175 forks. His project
centers around bash and zsh, TextMate, Vim, and Rails.

##### Robby Russell (@robbyrussell)

Robby Russell (@robbyrussell) started up oh-my-zsh, a community of some
250 forks surrounding zsh.

##### Ryan Tomayko (@rtomayko)

Ryan Tomayko (@rtomayko) open sourced his dotfiles with a great set of
documentation and some 150 developers watching the repository.

### tools

#### gnu stow

* [GNU Stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)

GNU Stow is a symlink farm manager which takes distinct packages of
software and/or data located in separate directories on the filesystem,
and makes them appear to be installed in the same place. For
example, /usr/local/bin could contain symlinks to files within
/usr/local/stow/emacs/bin, /usr/local/stow/perl/bin etc., and likewise
recursively for any other subdirectories such as .../share, .../man,
and so on.

This is particularly useful for keeping track of system-wide and per-user
installations of software built from source, but can also facilitate a
more controlled approach to management of configuration files in the
user's home directory, especially when coupled with version control
systems.
