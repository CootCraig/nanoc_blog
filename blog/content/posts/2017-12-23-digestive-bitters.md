<h4>Paracelsus Elixir – The Original Swedish Bitters Formula</h4>

Paracelsus Elixir is the original Swedish bitters formula. Paracelsus
Elixir is not the Maria Treben nor is it Dr. Samst’s formula for Swedish
Bitters. It is the Original Swedish Bitters Formula that had been lost
for centuries. Swedish bitters are also called Schwedenbitter in German.

Swedish Bitters were originally formulated by Paracelsus just prior to
1538 AD. Paracelsus Elixir is his original complete formula for Swedish
bitters or Schwedenbitter. We do not know what Paracelsus called this
formula but, it is quite certain that having been Swiss, he would not
have named it Swedish bitters. In homage to Paracelsus; giving him full
credit for this marvelous and ingenious world renowned formulation, we
have respectfully called it Paracelsus Elixir rather than just marketing
it as ordinary Swedish Bitters or Schwedenbitter.

When you are buying Paracelsus Elixir you are not buying what is commonly
being sold as Swedish Bitters. What is commonly being sold as Swedish
Bitters or Schwedenbitter is known as the “Maria Treben formula.” That
herbal combination for Swedish bitters was not formulated by Maria Treben
herself. It is a very abbreviated version of the original which has many
variations and which is not commonly sold probably because of expense and
the bother of having to market a new formula. this is the only formula
for Swedish Bitters we have ever used and sold for over 35 -40 years.

Our Paracelsus Elixir formula is over 460 years old. Why anyone would
ever arbitrarily change it and still market it as Swedish bitters is a
little confusing. It certainly would not improve it. In fact, by altering
it is no longer Swedish bitters. The ingredients and their proportions
of Paracelsus Elixir do not resemble any other Swedish Bitters formula
commonly being sold as Swedish bitters. In Herbalism the proportions
of herbs in any formula are a very delicate matter. If altered, it is
basically a different formula with different effects.

  About Bitters

<h5>Our bodies are built for bitters</h5>

As human beings we evolved consuming a vast amount of wild plants, most
of which were rich in the bitter flavor. With the birth of industrial
agriculture, the bitter flavor was stripped away in exchange for mostly
pleasant flavors: sweet, salty and processed food. Today we have a
dramatic lack of bitterness in our daily diets.

But our bod­ies are built for bitter flavors! Bitter engages and
excites the digestive system. Bitter challenges the body, alerting
it through taste that a complex food is being ingested, more complex
than heavily processed food. It is very important for the body to have
enough challenge—challenge keeps us strong, on our toes, ready for
action! Bitters are like the gym for the digestive system, they help to
keep it toned.

Our brilliant tongue is like the doorbell to the digestive system and
when we taste something bitter it rings that doorbell, “Ding-dong! Time
to eat, time to wake up, time to digest!” All the digestive organs get
“turned on.” They start to secrete digestive juices in preparation
for the incoming food!

<h5>The History of Bitters</h5>

The first bitters were probably foraged: any root, or green leaf, from
the wild would contain an appreciable element of bitterness. This is
because of the chemistry involved: many bitter compounds are there to
deter insects, or help plants have a strong immune response, and are
abundant in wild plants. But as humans organized early medical systems,
we see attention to the bitter flavor in almost every culture, from
Ayurveda and Chinese medicine, to the original bitter liquids of the
Mediterranean (the first record of these is over 2,000 years old).

Folk preparations evolved over the years, but the value of bitters
for digestive support and as antidotes to what might harm us was always
recognized. Some formulas gained more attention: from the amari of Italy,
to the famous Swedish bitters, to bitter melon chutney, these classic
preparations became cultural staples.

As global trade began to expand, exotic herbs and spices made it into
the mix, and we see the rise of now-famous brands such as Angostura and
Peychaud’s. Though we think of them as cocktail mixers now, these
blends are so much more than that: clearly digestive bitters, they
were originally marketed as tonic medicines. In fact, tonic water—a
quinine-based bitter preparation - was as much a medicine as it was a
drink back in the 19th century.

Today, we are seeing a fantastic resurgence of bitters across the bar
and medicine world. The riot of flavors, colors, and spices available
was unheard of twenty years ago. Our hope is that, as more folks begin
to appreciate that bitter is indeed better, we’ll see renewed interest
in the health benefits they can provide.

<h4>Inspired by a rich history.</h4>

The original bitters recipe dates back to the 16th century, when it
was created by the famous physician Paracelsus. It wasn't until 1850,
when Dr. Claus Samst of Sweden refined, researched and confirmed its
restorative benefits that it was given the name Swedish Bitters. He was
a zealous believer in the potion and consumed it himself, living to the
ripe old age of 104. Maria Treben is credited with placing the formula
in the modern spotlight through her best-selling book Health Through
God's Pharmacy.

Maria's original Swedish Bitters represent the essence of skill, knowledge
and experience in producing the finest quality herbal bitters. Only
premium ingredients have been selected to achieve the highest quality
and potency. They are ideal to use before meals to stimulate digestion
or after meals to lessen feelings of fullness or gas.

<h5>Bitters:</h5> Herbal extracts of bitter, mineral-rich herbs are a
traditional tonic for stimulating the bile and increasing digestion and
assimilation of fats. They often are the best remedy for calming a queasy
stomach. One such product is made by Floradix. Another is Swedish Bitters
originally formulated by Paracelsus and later “rediscovered” by a
Swedish scientist. Bitters supply nutrients from bitter leaves that are
often lacking in the Western diet. Many cultures, including the Chinese
and Hindu, value bitter herbs for their cleansing, strengthening and
healing properties.
