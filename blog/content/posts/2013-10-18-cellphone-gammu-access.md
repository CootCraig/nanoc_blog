### [Gammu](http://wammu.eu/gammu/)

Gammu is the name of the project as well as name of command line utility,
which you can use to control your phone. It is written in C and built on top
of libGammu

Gammu command line utility provides access to wide range of phone features,
however support level differs from phone to phone and you might want to check
the Gammu Phone Database for user experiences with various
phones. Generally following features are supported:

<ul>
<li>
Call listing, initiating and handling
</li>
<li>
SMS retrieval, backup and sending
</li>
<li>
MMS retrieval
</li>
<li>
Phonebook listing, export and import (also from standard formats such as vCard)
</li>
<li>
Calendar and tasks listing, export and import (also from standard formats
such as vCalendar or iCalendar)
</li>
<li>
Retrieval of phone and network information
</li>
<li>
Access to phone file system (note that some phones work also as USB
storage devices and those are not accessible through Gammu)
</li>
</ul>

This project has originally forked from Gnokii and up to version 0.58 has been
named MyGnokii2. Then need for better name arrived and Gammu was chosen as an
acronym for Gammu All Mobile Management Utilities, without knowing that Gammu
from the "Heretics of Dune" book written by Frank Herbert exists.
