Welcome to Scribus, a page layout program for Linux, FreeBSD, PC-BSD,
NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, OpenIndiana, Debian GNU/Hurd, Mac OS X, OS/2
Warp 4, eComStation, Haiku and Windows. Since its humble beginning in
the spring of 2001, Scribus has evolved into one of the premier Open
Source desktop applications. Encouraged by professionals and beginners
alike, the Scribus Team, with support from a large and growing number of
enthusiastic contributors from all over the world, is dedicated to develop
and improve “one of the most powerful and useful open-source projects
out there” (TechRepublic). Underneath a user-friendly interface,
Scribus supports professional publishing features, such as CMYK colors,
spot colors, ICC color management and versatile PDF creation. Scribus
has many unexpected touches, such as powerful vector drawing tools,
support for a huge number of file types via import/export filters,
emulation of color blindness or the rendering of markup languages like
LaTeX or Lilypond inside Scribus. The Scribus file format is XML-based
and open. Unlike proprietary binary file formats, even damaged documents
can be recovered with a simple text editor
