<h3>
 a class factory and dsl for generating command line programs real quick
  <a href="https://github.com/ahoward/main" target="_blank">github.com/ahoward/main</a>
</h3>

for simple programs main.rb is a real time saver but it's for more
complex applications where main.rb's unification of parameter parsing,
class configuration dsl, and auto-generation of usage messages can
really streamline command line application development.  for example
the following 'a.rb' program

Trollop is a commandline option parser for Ruby that just gets out of
your way. One line of code per option is all you need to write. For that,
you get a nice automatically-generated help page, robust option parsing,
command subcompletion, and sensible defaults for everything you don't
specify.

</h3>

GLI's whole point is to create a polished UI for your command suite
application. This describes the basics of the interface that is generated
by a GLI-based application.

GLI is the best way to make a “command-suite” command-line
application, e.g. one like git (for the best way to make a simpler
command-line application, check out methadone).

GLI allows you to make a polished, easy-to-maintain command-line
application without a lot of syntax, but without restricting you in any
way from the power of OptionParser.

  Methadone - kick the bash habit and start your command line apps off right

The goal of this project is to make it as easy as possible to write awesome and powerful command-line applications.

  clamp - a Ruby command-line application framework

<h4>Not another one!</h4>

Yeah, sorry. There are a bunch of existing command-line parsing libraries
out there, and Clamp draws inspiration from a variety of sources,
including Thor, optparse, and Clip. In the end, though, I wanted a
slightly rounder wheel. (Although, Clamp has a lot in common with Ara
T. Howard's main.rb. Had I been aware of that project at the time,
I might not have written Clamp.)
