#### Visualize Your Data With VTK

The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an open-source, freely available
software system for 3D computer graphics, image processing, and
visualization. It consists of a C++ class library and several interpreted
interface layers including Tcl/Tk, Java, and Python. VTK supports a wide
variety of visualization algorithms including scalar, vector, tensor,
texture, and volumetric methods, as well as advanced modeling techniques
such as implicit modeling, polygon reduction, mesh smoothing, cutting,
contouring, and Delaunay triangulation. VTK has an extensive information
visualization framework and a suite of 3D interaction widgets. The toolkit
supports parallel processing and integrates with various databases on
GUI toolkits such as Qt and Tk. VTK is cross-platform and runs on Linux,
Windows, Mac, and Unix platforms. VTK is part of Kitwareâ€™s collection
of commercially supported open-source platforms for software development.
