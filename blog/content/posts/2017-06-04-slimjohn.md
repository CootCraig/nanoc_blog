I highly recommend that you take sufficient vitamin D3, vitamin A,
and vitamin K complex with a lot of MK-7 to prevent calcification.

Good on the homocysteine decrease!   

Try taking pure niacin (nicotinic acid); start at low dose and work up.
I used to take Slo-Niacin and pure niacin flush is not any different.
Take after a meal and drink plenty of fluid.

Also, consider taking aged garlic with the fish oil.  There is
a synergistic effect. See my post on this thread: "Fish Oil still
good??" I take 2 capsules 2x daily of Kyolic Aged Garlic Extract Extra
Strength RESERVE Cardiovascular (iherb.com carries this). Each capsule
is 600mg. See this thread

Thanks for the update!  Well, that article -- apparently his organization
released it to PR news organization -- should have been reviewed before
release. Makes me wonder how anyone, particularly those in research,
can accidentally confuse 1200mg with 2400mg.  Not only that, but there
has been no correction AFAIK.  Dr. Budoff made a presentation at the
9th annual scientific meeting of the Society of Cardiovascular Computed
Tomography to be held July 10-13, 2014 in San Diego, California. I've
not see anything on the study in print.

Nevertheless, I will stay with the 2400 mg AGE and evaluate throughout
the remainder of the year (some things take longer to show consistent
benefits). The PR news mistake may be the best unintentional benefit. :-)
As with most substances, the rate of benefit effects decline with dosage
so 2x dosage does not necessarily mean 2x benefit outcomes. Anything
above 1x is okay with me. LOL

Regardless, this is one substance where being aggressive may just be
optimal at least beyond the plaque reduction. It reduces vascular
smooth muscle proliferation, decreases oxLDL, increases eNOS and
NO (endothelial function), and naturally increases the endogenous
antioxidants glutathione, glutathione reductase, and SOD (superoxide
dismutase), improves lipids via reduction of HMG COA reductase
(similar to statins) to reduce total cholesterol and triglycerides.
I especially like natural induced increase in endogenous antioxidants.
It also increases activation of AMPK so all good to me.

Linda - LCL: I've had similar huge swings in LDL-P and I've got Lp(a)
as well.  Dr. D has mentioned several times that some folks, especially
those with Lp(a) are very sensitive to carbohydrate indulgences, such
that they can cause huge increases in small particles and take weeks to
wear off.  I'm kind of thinking that's what it might be.

You Are Likely to Live Long or Die Young.  authors: James Braly M.D.,

<h5>slimjohn on homocysteine</h5>

<blockquote style="margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 2em;">
Following the guidelines of The H Factor Solution should reduce
homocysteine.  However, for some, getting to 6 may not be so easy.
While the authors offer suggestions on diet and supplements, keep in mind
that one's mileage may differ and they may be insufficient. For example,
folic acid may work for some people but for most 5-MTHR (methlyfolate)
is superior. Some people may require higher dosages methylfolate
than recommended (I do!). They mention TMG (TMG converts homocysteine
back to methionine) but note that they state that for some people much
higher dosages may be required. If you are sensitive to too much methyl
groups/TMG you may experience side effects (fatigue, nausea, hair loss,
dizziness, spaciness).

So, it may be best at some time to consider optimizing methylation and
to know how the various B vitamins effect certain polymorphisms. Since
methylation is a big, critical part of reducing homocysteine, it may
be best to get 23andme genetic data to see what specifically may need
addressing to optimize methylation. Make the adjustments and follow up
with methylation panel to confirm. For example, I have COMT polymorphism
that processes methyl groups slowly. I take niacin that consumed methyl
groups and seems to offset COMT effects. That's a double benefit. I've
had to make adjustments after adding TMG which seems to work directly
within the methionione cycle and does not effect COMT (I've not noticed).
I added TMG about 3 months ago and am holding off to get a ton of labs
next months so the results will tell me how the protocol is working.

Purchase the book.  There's more to the protocol than just supplements.
:-)

  <li>Vitamin K2 (as menaquinone-7) 200 mcg</li>
  <li>Vitamin K1 (phyloquinne) 200 mcg</li>
</ul>

<h4>Vitacost Vitamin K2 (MK-7) with Nattokinase</h4>

  <li>MK-7 (Vitamin K2 as Menaquinone-7) 100 mcg</li>
  <li>Nattokinase (from Natto Extract) 320  FU (Fibrin Units)</li>
</ul>

I take both mornings and evenings (for a couple of years now) to ensure
I have 24 hour coverage. Does it work? Who knows?  I will get CAC scan
soon so that may give some indication if arterial inflammation has
slowed expanding surfaces for possible calcification.  What I do know
is that it is better to have sufficient Ks than insufficient Ks with
reduced level carboxylation of matrix GLA which makes for an arterial
wall primer for calcification.

I also ensure that I get plenty of magnesium (Natural Calm, 600mg- 900mg)
that inhibits the calcification (phosphate binding) chemistry. It all
depends on the level of D3 (which varies over the day & night). Vitamin
A (retinol) does prevent excessive level of D3 (A is antagonist of D3;
visa versa).  Note: Vitamin K is needed to help the body make blood clots;
people taking anti-coagulant and anti-platelet medication should consult
their doctor before adding Vitamin K to their daily regimen.

<pre>
Swanson Ultra Apigenin
90 capsules 50mg
Pure grapefruit-derived flavonoid
</pre>

It seems that resveratrol increases the bioavailability of apigenin when
both taken together, at least in this study.

One of the most interesting I have noticed in doing exercise is that I do
not get as tired as I used to and now when I take a break the recovery
is fast. BTY, I use push mower to mow the lawn as exercise.  I have a
huge lawn area to mow. I can control the interval intensity as I strive
for endurance. I can go for hours and not feel drained as I had in the
past. I can not attribute this to conditioning because for the last
several months I have not had grass to mow and the weather limited any
running-trotting down the road. I have monitored this for days to see
if this could just be a transient thing and it appears to be consistent.

To what I attribute this new energy? I have been taking high dosages
of Apigenin and Resveratrol for a few weeks as part of my protocol,
based on research, to slow cancerous B-lymphocyte growth, etc.  Note:
I do not take quercetin because it greatly slows thyroid function and
may interfere with COMT gene function. Apigenin inhibits CD38 on these
cells and selectively slows cell growth and may promote apoptosis (cell
death) of these cancerous cells without harming healthy cells. At least,
this is the best hypothesis of apigenin effect on CD38.

The only indication that apigenin and resveratrol are at play is the
very noticeable increased energy.  The increase in energy lead me to
investigate possible causes.  What I present here is my best possible
explanation.  I will continue to monitor.

Alternate ways of increasing NAD+ include 2 days/week fasting and
calorie restriction which increase AMPK which then increases levels of
NAD+. I have been doing both so complementary to apigenin and resveratrol
supplementation.

I take apigenin (150mg/day) to inhibit CD38. I do not take NR -- but do
take niacin (1.5g/day) and resveratrol (supports NAD+). I am confident
that the apigenin is freeing up additional NAD that is giving me a nice
consistent level of energy (dare I say youthful energy?).  Inhibiting CD38
is good for restoring mitochondria function.  This should ameliorate
some characteristics of atherosclerosis (e.g., endothelial dysfunction)
over time.

My energy level remains high. This is not the energy sometimes associated
with hyperactivity but more of an energy capability that maintains a good
level with endurance reserve in which tiredness is only momentary. There
is an element of feeling good enough to "get up off my butt and do
something." I've been physically active recently and even after 8-9
hours I still have energy in the tank.   I will continue to monitor.

Now, what I do not know is whether this is a direct result of HIGH dosage
EGCG and Curcumin along with apigenin (part of CLL protocol) or not. I am
taking these supplements with BioPerine to increase bioavailability. I've
taken these supplements before but not at these dosages. This new energy
capacity may be due to increased level in blood stream due to increased
bioavailability for each supplement. Or, it may simply be due to CR
(calorie restriction) which does increase NAD+.

lconnolly - CYP3A4 is the "grapefruit effect" metabolizer.  Hmmmm,
your statin may lower your cholesterol too much if you take grapefruit
juice beforehand.  But CYP3A4 also metabolizes viagra.....would you want
your viagra to last longer?? Take grapefruit juice before taking viagra.
And I am not responsible for anything that happens.

lconnolly - Now Swanson's apigenin is made from grapefruit...but it is
a potent inhibitor of 2C9 not 3A4.  Naringin, in the other hand is 3A4.
2C9 also metabolizes most of your nsaids.  Would you like them to stick
around longer?

My current anti-CLL protocol:

<pre>
EGCG: 2g
Curcumin: 1.8g (time-release)
Apigenin: 150mg
Resveratrol: 1g

other supplements for atherosclerosis
high dose fish oil
high dose vitamin k2, mk-4 and mk-7
</pre>

These are minimum effectiveness levels for EGCG and Curcumin based on
Mayo Clinic and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center studies. The results, if any,
are dose dependent. I may have to increase EGCG and Curcumin to 4g each;
this means monitoring renal and liver function since these dosages are
pretty rough on the body. Apigenin level is based on extrapolation and
should be good enough to inhibit CD38. My thinking about apigenin is that
if it inhibits CD38 to any degree, it will make the cancer cells more
vulnerable to EGCG/Curcumin induction of apoptosis since cancer cells'
mitochondria are fragile anyway and this may help tilt the scale and
aid the process.

Of course, I am taking other supplements for atherosclerosis and they
are complementary in fighting cancer.  For example, high dose fish oil
(inhibits NF-kB) and high dose vitamin k2, mk-4 and mk-7 (depolarizes
leukemia cell mitochondria membrane, i.e., shuts down energy production).
Vitamins C, E, NAC, and other substances (e.g., SOD) that boost cell
endogenous antioxidants (glutathione, catalase, SOD) are excluded because
they support cancer cell function and proliferation.

<h2>Off to a new adventure + Updates</h2>

I have settled into a routine of heavy dose Curcumin and EGCG, each on
alternate days (there oppose each other). I also added Resveratrol and
Apigenin every day. All effect multiple pathways. Finally, I increased K2
Mk-4 to 60mg and will likely increase to 90mg since Mk-4 stops cancerous
stem cells, etc.  All based on research, human clinical trials, etc.
Hopefully this will increase the time to treatment and allow time for
newer non-chemo drugs to be introduced with better outcomes.

Recently, I have noticed an increase in energy level. I can mow (push
type, for exercise) the lawn for hours and not feel exhausted as I had
in the past. Energy comes from mitochondria so something is happening
to provide more energy. It could be more new mitochondria (probably)
or some mechanism that frees up ATP production (most likely).
