I highly recommend that you take sufficient vitamin D3, vitamin A,
and vitamin K complex with a lot of MK-7 to prevent calcification.

Good on the homocysteine decrease!   

Try taking pure niacin (nicotinic acid); start at low dose and work up.
I used to take Slo-Niacin and pure niacin flush is not any different.
Take after a meal and drink plenty of fluid.

Also, consider taking aged garlic with the fish oil.  There is
a synergistic effect. See my post on this thread: "Fish Oil still
good??" I take 2 capsules 2x daily of Kyolic Aged Garlic Extract Extra
Strength RESERVE Cardiovascular (iherb.com carries this). Each capsule
is 600mg. See this thread

Thanks for the update!  Well, that article -- apparently his organization
released it to PR news organization -- should have been reviewed before
release. Makes me wonder how anyone, particularly those in research,
can accidentally confuse 1200mg with 2400mg.  Not only that, but there
has been no correction AFAIK.  Dr. Budoff made a presentation at the
9th annual scientific meeting of the Society of Cardiovascular Computed
Tomography to be held July 10-13, 2014 in San Diego, California. I've
not see anything on the study in print.

Nevertheless, I will stay with the 2400 mg AGE and evaluate throughout
the remainder of the year (some things take longer to show consistent
benefits). The PR news mistake may be the best unintentional benefit. :-)
As with most substances, the rate of benefit effects decline with dosage
so 2x dosage does not necessarily mean 2x benefit outcomes. Anything
above 1x is okay with me. LOL

Regardless, this is one substance where being aggressive may just be
optimal at least beyond the plaque reduction. It reduces vascular
smooth muscle proliferation, decreases oxLDL, increases eNOS and
NO (endothelial function), and naturally increases the endogenous
antioxidants glutathione, glutathione reductase, and SOD (superoxide
dismutase), improves lipids via reduction of HMG COA reductase
(similar to statins) to reduce total cholesterol and triglycerides.
I especially like natural induced increase in endogenous antioxidants.
It also increases activation of AMPK so all good to me.

Linda - LCL: I've had similar huge swings in LDL-P and I've got Lp(a)
as well.  Dr. D has mentioned several times that some folks, especially
those with Lp(a) are very sensitive to carbohydrate indulgences, such
that they can cause huge increases in small particles and take weeks to
wear off.  I'm kind of thinking that's what it might be.

The H Factor Solution: Homocysteine, the Best Single Indicator of Whether
You Are Likely to Live Long or Die Young.  authors: James Braly M.D.,

<h5>slimjohn on homocysteine</h5>

<blockquote style="margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 2em;">
Following the guidelines of The H Factor Solution should reduce
homocysteine.  However, for some, getting to 6 may not be so easy.
While the authors offer suggestions on diet and supplements, keep in mind
that one's mileage may differ and they may be insufficient. For example,
folic acid may work for some people but for most 5-MTHR (methlyfolate)
is superior. Some people may require higher dosages methylfolate
than recommended (I do!). They mention TMG (TMG converts homocysteine
back to methionine) but note that they state that for some people much
higher dosages may be required. If you are sensitive to too much methyl
groups/TMG you may experience side effects (fatigue, nausea, hair loss,
dizziness, spaciness).

So, it may be best at some time to consider optimizing methylation and
to know how the various B vitamins effect certain polymorphisms. Since
methylation is a big, critical part of reducing homocysteine, it may
be best to get 23andme genetic data to see what specifically may need
addressing to optimize methylation. Make the adjustments and follow up
with methylation panel to confirm. For example, I have COMT polymorphism
that processes methyl groups slowly. I take niacin that consumed methyl
groups and seems to offset COMT effects. That's a double benefit. I've
had to make adjustments after adding TMG which seems to work directly
within the methionione cycle and does not effect COMT (I've not noticed).
I added TMG about 3 months ago and am holding off to get a ton of labs
next months so the results will tell me how the protocol is working.

Purchase the book.  There's more to the protocol than just supplements.
:-)

I take early morning and late evenings: by slimjohn
</h2>

<h4>Early Morning -</h4>

<ul>
  <li>1 each - Life Extension Super K with Advanced K2 Complex</li>
  <li>1 each - Vitacost Vitamin K2 (MK-7) with Nattokinase</li>
</ul>

<h4>Late Evening -</h4>

<ul>
  <li>1 each - Life Extension Super K with Advanced K2 Complex</li>
  <li>1 each - Vitacost Vitamin K2 (MK-7) with Nattokinase</li>
</ul>

<h4>Vitacost Vitamin K Complex</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Vitamin K2 (as menaquinone-7) 200 mcg</li>
  <li>Vitamin K1 (phyloquinne) 200 mcg</li>
</ul>

<h4>Vitacost Vitamin K2 (MK-7) with Nattokinase</h4>

<ul>
  <li>MK-7 (Vitamin K2 as Menaquinone-7) 100 mcg</li>
  <li>Nattokinase (from Natto Extract) 320  FU (Fibrin Units)</li>
</ul>

I take both mornings and evenings (for a couple of years now) to ensure
I have 24 hour coverage. Does it work? Who knows?  I will get CAC scan
soon so that may give some indication if arterial inflammation has
slowed expanding surfaces for possible calcification.  What I do know
is that it is better to have sufficient Ks than insufficient Ks with
reduced level carboxylation of matrix GLA which makes for an arterial
wall primer for calcification.

I also ensure that I get plenty of magnesium (Natural Calm, 600mg- 900mg)
that inhibits the calcification (phosphate binding) chemistry. It all
depends on the level of D3 (which varies over the day & night). Vitamin
A (retinol) does prevent excessive level of D3 (A is antagonist of D3;
visa versa).  Note: Vitamin K is needed to help the body make blood clots;
people taking anti-coagulant and anti-platelet medication should consult
their doctor before adding Vitamin K to their daily regimen.
