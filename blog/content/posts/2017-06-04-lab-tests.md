My first thought is to look at inflammation and what is driving it. Begin by looking at Omega-6: Omega-3 ratio. For most Americans, Omega-6s are too high. Omega-6s lead to inflammatory products. Do a search here for "Barry Sears" here; there are several threads discussing this.

Yes, get NMR or VAP, homocysteine, hsCRP. I prefer NMR but often get both to compare.

Get full thyroid panel to include reverse T3 and autoimmune antibodies.

You can order these test yourself online from places like www.privatemdlabs.com

What is your carb, protein, fat (sat fat, PUFA, etc.) in gms or calories. See FitDay (online) for help with this.

Yes, most here avoid wheat products.  However, you don't want to go too low with carbs either; slows metabolism and can give symptoms of hypothyroidism. 

Get Dr. Mark Houston's book: "What Your Doctor May NOT Tell You About Heart Disease" today!
Get Dr. Stephen Sinatra's book: "The Sinatra Solution: Metabolic Cardiology" today!
Get Dr. Barry Sears' books:
"The Inflammation Zone: Reversing the Silent Epidemic that's Destroying our Health" today!
"Toxic Fat: When Good Fat Turns Bad" today!

That's it for a start. I am sure other may have additional advice.
