  Indian River in Florida

The Indian River is a 121-mile (195 km) long[1] brackish lagoon in
Florida,[2] and is part of the Indian River Lagoon system, which in turn
forms part of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway.

<h2>Port St. Lucie Florida</h2>

Port St. Lucie is a sprawling tropical city on the Treasure Coast of
Florida. The population is 174,110 and 444,420 in its metropolitan
area. It is known by its residents by its initials, PSL. The spring
training home of the New York Mets, this city has many fun activities
if you know where to look; the new downtown area is in its infancy,
but once complete will bring more activities for residents and visitors.

  <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/zippel_bay/index.html" target="_blank">Zippel Bay State Park</a>
</h2>

After visiting Zippel Bay, you’ll remember the sunsets and the miles
of white sand beach. The park is located on Lake of the Woods, one of
the world’s largest lakes. The mood of the lake is always changing,
from approaching storms that bring three-foot-high crashing waves and
lightning flashes to an eerie stillness, broken only by the faint calls
of a thousand raucous gulls, out of sight in the lake’s interior. In
summer, the 3,000-acre park offers a swimming beach and picnic area on
the big lake, drive-in campsites and a group camp, a marina on Zippel
Bay and a stone jetty providing protected access to Lake of the Woods.
