  Indian River in Florida
</h2>

The Indian River is a 121-mile (195 km) long[1] brackish lagoon in
Florida,[2] and is part of the Indian River Lagoon system, which in turn
forms part of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway.

<h2>Port St. Lucie Florida</h2>

Port St. Lucie is a sprawling tropical city on the Treasure Coast of
Florida. The population is 174,110 and 444,420 in its metropolitan
area. It is known by its residents by its initials, PSL. The spring
training home of the New York Mets, this city has many fun activities
if you know where to look; the new downtown area is in its infancy,
but once complete will bring more activities for residents and visitors.
