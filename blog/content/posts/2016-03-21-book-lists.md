  Classics for the people
</h4>
In London, the Working Men’s College became nationally famous under
Sir John Lubbock, its principal between 1883 and 1899. Lubbock drew up
a list of the 100 books it was most important for a working man to read.

  The Book List: Meet Sir John Lubbock, Godfather of the must-read listicle
</h4>

We have the Godfather of the Best Books List to thank for setting
this hare running: banker and philanthropist Sir John Lubbock
(1834–1913). Though all but forgotten today, Lubbock was an important
man, the MP responsible for introducing the Bank Holidays Act (1871),
and as principal of the Working Men’s College in London, he gave a
speech in 1886 in which he listed 100 books.

“I drew up the list,” he said, which excluded living authors,
“not as that of the hundred best books, but, which is very different,
of those which on the whole are perhaps best worth reading.” It was
then published and became a bestseller, with a knock-on effect on the
books mentioned. It is printed above, and in the order he listed the
titles. His top 100 (which appears to be more like 100-ish on close
inspection) was organised by category, eg philosophy, travel, history,
but he was wary about a “science” section on the basis that “science
is so rapidly progressive”.

  25+ Classic Chapter Books to Read with 5-8 Year Olds
</h4>
Following on from the very popular 50 Classic Picture Books list, today
I am sharing over 25+ Classic Chapter Books to read aloud with 5-8
year olds. The titles in this collection have stood the test of time,
and the list includes simple novels and a few story collections that
children in the early elementary/primary years will enjoy.

All published prior to 1980, these are the books that we loved as
children that are perfect for reading aloud to our own kids – though
older children will enjoy many of these as independent reads too.
