Granberg Model G776 Alaskan MKIII Chainsaw mill 36"

Here you can see the un-boxing and complete setup of the Granberg Alaskan
chainsaw mill. Initially I will be pairing the mill with a Stihl MS 661
running a 32" bar with a custom ripping chain.

I will be using the chainsaw mill to create the lumber needed for a
small off grid cabin I am building.

clutch, and wider clutch cover for better dispersal of wood chips. This
saw also has the power and balance to take longer bar lengths.
