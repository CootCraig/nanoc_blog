## Tune your antenna for better DX - Construction of random length wire AM antenna

[Tune your antenna for better DX](http://www.hard-core-dx.com/nordicdx/antenna/lab/coupler.html)

by Roy A. Walton (adapted by Bruce Carter)

If you use a "Pi-Section Coupler", your antenna can be as short as 30 feet
or as long as 100 feet. The combination can be made to work efficiently
at all frequencies between 500 and 6800 kHz.

## [Chris Ridley - BUILD A TUNED LOOP](http://www.mwcircle.org/mw_loop_tuned.htm)

How can you vastly improve your Medium Wave reception? its quite simple
really, all you need is 120 foot of wire, a few lengths of timber and
an old tuning capacitor with which you can build the answer to every
DX'ers prayers, a tuned loop antenna.

## [Pickup Loop for AM Loop Antenna](http://www.mtmscientific.com/pickup.html)

The coupling from the antenna to the radio is through the ferrite loop
antenna inside most portable AM radios. We have received several inquries
about the possibility of conneting the antenna to a regular component
receiver.  Although every situation is different, it is generally easy
to do.

## [Review - MTM Scientific AM Loop Antenna](http://www.radiointel.com/review-amloop.htm)

The MTM Scientific AM Loop Antenna is quite a different animal from all
of those however for a few reasons. First it is a large square wood frame
loop measuring slightly over 17" per side which makes it at least twice
the size of the other passive AM loops I mentioned. This seemed like an
exciting prospect as it seemed likely it would be able to capture more
signal than the smaller loops.


## [Loop Antennas](http://www.frontiernet.net/~jadale/Loop.htm)

A loop antenna is a small multi turn loop of less than 1/10th wavelength
in length. The loop is wound on a form, which may be either box
(solenoid), or spiral (pancake) wound. The core material can either be
air, or a powdered iron compound (Ferrite). The gain of a loop is much
less than a longwire, but it has much less noise pickup. A properly
designed Loop primarily responds to the magnetic component of the radio
wave. Note that noise resides primarily in the electrical component. A
vertical antenna responds mainly to the electrical component.

A loop antenna is an antenna primarily for the AM broadcast and the Longwave bands.

### exray	

I think the generalization about 'how many feet' is more of a ballpark
consideration. If you're using a typical BCB range tuning cap like
365-400pf you're going to fall into the 50-75 ft range almost inherently
for most practical sizes and thats never been a bad thing.

Now if you want to use something like 200 feet of wire (a la some of
these wacky broomstick or liter-coke bottle ideas) and find a cap to
tune it with you'll immediately see the uh-oh at 1700 kcs. And the other
extreme...20 feet of wire at 550kc.

That said, you'll run into the unavailability of standard parts and
having to multi-bandswitch the thing to cover BCB probably before you
will encounter the differences in actual peformance.

If you are building a 2-3' size loop with a typical BCB cap you can tune
the entire range without tapping it. The difference in wire length should
not be noticeable.

## [Medium Wave One Tube Loop Radio](http://makearadio.com/tube/loopradio.php)

I am proud to introduce you to my first loop tube radio. I had this
in mind for a while and it took me a long time to get started. The
radio design was simple, but how was I to make this into another show
piece radio? Do I make it into a 1920's look, or a rock n' roll 50's
radio? This one is both. The design, and parts are something that you
might have seen in a 1950's Poptronics magazine. Then there are some
hints that have that definite roaring 20's look. The loop itself is an
example as well as the art deco GaroliteÂ® front panel. The wood base
gives this radio a breadboard look. I sure did it all. This puppy kept
me up nights thinking how I was going to build her. I like that curve
that decorates the front panel. I used a large pizza pan as a guide.

The radio is a simple regenerative type using a 6418 subminiature
tube. This is a pentode tube that has a 30 volt plate maximum rating. The
filament runs on 1.25 volts at 10ma. With 18 volts on the plate and a
low current filament, the batteries will last a long time.
