We believe that the Old and New Testaments are the inspired Word of
God, the only infallible rule for faith and life. We afﬁrm 
<a href="https://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/creeds" target="_blank">three creeds</a>
—the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian
Creed—as ecumenical expressions of the Christian faith. We also afﬁrm
<a href="https://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/confessions" target="_blank">three confessions</a>
—the 
<a href="https://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/confessions/belgic-confession" target="_blank">Belgic Confession</a>
, the 
<a href="https://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/confessions/heidelberg-catechism" target="_blank">Heidelberg Catechism</a>
, and the 
<a href="https://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/confessions/canons-dort" target="_blank">Canons of Dort</a>
—as historic Reformed expressions of the Christian
faith, whose doctrines fully agree with the Word of God.

following Reformed expressions of the Christian faith, adopted by synod as
contemporary testimonies: the call for unity, justice, and reconciliation
of the Belhar Confession and the witness of Our World Belongs to God:

  <a href="https://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/creeds/apostles-creed" target="_blank">Apostles' Creed</a>
</h4>

This creed is called the Apostles' Creed not because it was produced
by the apostles themselves but because it contains a brief summary of
their teachings.

<h4>
  <a href="https://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/creeds/athanasian-creed" target="_blank">Athanasian Creed</a>
</h4>

Apart from the opening and closing sentences, this creed consists of
two parts, the first setting forth the orthodox doctrine of the trinity,
and the second dealing chiefly with the incarnation and the two-natures
doctrine.

<h4>
  <a href="https://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/creeds/athanasian-creed" target="_blank">Nicene Creed</a>
</h4>

The Nicene Creed, also called the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan Creed,
is a statement of the orthodox faith of the early Christian church in
opposition to certain heresies, especially Arianism.
