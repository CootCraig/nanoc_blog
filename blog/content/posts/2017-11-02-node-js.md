Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript
engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes
it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the
largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

<h4>Small to medium projects</h4>

Everything works out of the box, you get great support for most features
and you can easily tap into Express' middleware ecosystem. What's not
to love?

Some of the included features: body and file parsers, cookies, sessions,
websockets, Redis, gzip, favicon, csrf, SSL, etc. They just work so you
will save a headache or two and can focus on your actual project. Get
a simple form going:

In this tutorial you will learn how to get started with Node.js
development and create a project from scratch. While there are many ways
of doing it, this guide is focused first on making it easy and second
on using common tools.

You will need some basic tools like having a git and a code editor (we
recommend Atom) as well as some basic knowledge around your operative
system and the terminal/command line.
