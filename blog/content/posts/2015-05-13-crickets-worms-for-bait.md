Several species of earthworms are found in the U.S.  The nightcrawler,
Lumbricus terrestris Linnaeus, and the red earthworm, Lumbricus rubellus
Hoffmeister, are the most common larger species.  Smaller species belong
to the genera Allolobophora and Eisenia. Earthworms are generally found
in the top 12" to 18" of the soil because this is where food is most
abundant.  The worm ingests soil and organic matter that is swallowed and
ground in the gizzard. The ejected material (called castings) is used to
line the burrow or is deposited at the entrance (on the lawn surface).
Earthworm activity is greatest when soil is warm and moist, becoming
active when soil thaws in the spring.  The worms will move deep into
the soil if it becomes dry during the summer.
