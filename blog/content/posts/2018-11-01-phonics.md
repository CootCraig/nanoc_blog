  Phonics, the most effective way to teach how to read
</h2>

According to the Report of the National Reading Panel a truly effective reading program
includes systematic, direct instruction in these <b>FIVE ELEMENTS:</b>

<b>PHONEMIC AWARENESS</b>
The knowledge and ability to recognize that words are made up of a combination of individual speech sounds.

<b>PHONICS</b>
A body of knowledge consisting of 26 letters used to symbolize 44 English speech sounds. There are about 70 most common spellings for these speech sounds.

<b>VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT</b>
Adding to the number of words used and understood by the student.

<b>FLUENCY</b>
The ability to read text accurately and smoothly.

<b>COMPREHENSION</b>
The ability to understand what we can read and talk about.

<h5>Phonics Primer</h5>

You can use this Phonics Primer developed by The National Right to Read
Foundation to begin teaching a child or adult to read today. This primer
lists the 44 sounds in the English language and then gives steps for
teaching those 44 sounds and their most common spelling patterns. In
addition to learning sounds and spellings, each day the student must
read lists of phonetically related words and spell these words from
dictation. Phonics instruction must be reinforced by having the student
read decodable text.

  Review of Alpha-Phonics by Blumenfeld
</h4>

Alpha-Phonics now available on Kindle!! It is the same and is every
bit as simple and effective as the book which first came out in 1983.
The Kindle version has been carefully designed to work as easily for
the Kindle viewer as it has proven to be for the print version user for
so long.

Alpha-Phonics. Probably the simplest, most effective systematic,
intensive phonics reading instruction program available today. HERE’S
WHY IT WORKS SO WELL: IT IS SIMPLE!!There are only 44 phonograms (sounds)
the child needs to learn. There are only 44 sounds needed for the entire
English language. Reading is simple to teach because all you have to do
is teach the student to SOUND OUT the words they are trying to read. At
first they sound the words out LOUD then later they do it in their
head silently. That is ALL there is to teaching reading. Student begins
with short vowels putting simplest words together (Like a plus m = am
or a plus s = as; etc) and progresses to the more advanced words. With
Alpha-Phonics the beginner can be reading simple sentences by lesson
three, and that can be even on the first day!

Other programs try to do too much. They inject grammar, pictures and
other material, needlessly complicating the task. With Alpha-Phonics
you just teach reading only. Alpha-Phonics has a BONUS in that you
EASILY teach SPELLING as you go, lesson by lesson. You just spend
a few minutes with each lesson doing oral and written dictation to
teach spelling. Alpha-Phonics easily introduces over 3,500 words in
its simple 128 lessons. Many children learn reading in only months.
Alpha-Phonics also works very well for older, even grown adult, students
who need remediation. Highly endorsed by leading homeschooling product
reviewers Cathy Duffy and Mary Pride.

Alpha-Phonics is regularly recommended by The Robinson Curriculum
organization. Print version used very successfully by hundreds of
thousands for almost 30 years by parents, tutors and teachers. Works
exceptionally well in teaching English as a Second Language. Publisher
has a 24/7 Helpline if you need assistance. Amazon also has optional
accompanying Readers and Practice Workbook. SPECIAL NOTE: Is there a
negative about Alpha-Phonics? Yes. In the more than 25 years we’ve
published Alpha-Phonics we have heard only one criticism. here it is:
Some Moms say they think their child can become bored when taught
with Alpha-Phonics. Too many parents are used to having fun-like,
non-essential Bells & whistles, playing card decks, spin the needle,
etc. Public Education has eschewed drill. They feel you have to entertain
kids while teaching them. This only slows down the process. What many Moms
don’t realize is that with Alpha-Phonics their student can be READING
simple sentences even on day one! Students do see a lot of words in the
lessons of Alpha-Phonics, but they quickly are READING those words; they
are accomplishing, not being entertained. Moms who feel it looks boring
soon realize their child is actually learning to READ (To sound out)
words (Over 3,500 new words in Alpha-Phonics). Besides, those bells
& whistles make the program more expensive and complicated. The huge
sense of success in actually reading will soon overcome any short-lived
sense of boredom. This makes ultimately for very happy Moms, Dads AND
students. We almost forgot a super BONUS for some parents in using
Alpha-Phonics with their children: Many of the adults become better
readers as they progress through Alpha-Phonics with their child. Go
with the one that has weathered the test of time. Go with the one that
is SIMPLE, EFFECTIVE and INEXPENSIVE: Go with ALPHA-PHONICS

The mission of The National Right to Read Foundation is to educate,
advocate and encourage the application of the definitive findings of
experimental, empirical research in reading instruction. This is the
critical ingredient needed to move forward with the reforms necessary
to reduce, and ultimately eliminate illiteracy.

Reading curricula for colleges of education and for public, private,
sectarian and home-schooled students should all include direct,
systematic instruction in phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary
development, fluency and comprehension that decades of experimental,
empirical research have proven to be the most effective.

All students must first “learn to read” proficiently. Then, and only
then, will they be able to “read to learn” and thus have access
to the vast treasure house of literature available at home, online,
in the workplace, and in libraries everywhere. The National Right to
Read Foundation is committed to providing information on a variety of
scientifically validated resources to help parents and teachers accomplish
these objectives.

  How to Teach Phonics (And How Not To) By Cheryl Lowe
</h3>

In the Summer 2014 Classical Teacher, I wrote an extensive article
exploring the question, “What is the Classical Approach to Phonics?”
The contention of that article was that there are two basic approaches
to phonics in the classical education world: the traditional method and
the Spalding method.

The Spalding method is based on the book The Writing Road to Reading
(WRTR), written in 1957 by Romalda Spalding. Because the original 300-page
manual is quite difficult, there have been a number of spin-offs that
have sought to make the WRTR method more accessible.

...

In this article I will review the two approaches and critique the
Spalding method in terms of the principles of traditional and classical
education. For the Spalding method I will use the 1990 edition of WRTR
as I did in the previous article. For the traditional method I will use
A Guide to Teaching Phonics by June Lyday Orton. There are many other
traditional programs I could have chosen, but the Orton Guide is well
organized, simple, and has great credibility due to the pioneering work
in phonics of Dr. Orton. Moreover, I want to emphasize that Orton is
in every respect a traditional method, despite the common belief that
Orton and Spalding are very similar.

<h5>The Traditional (Orton) Method</h5>

Traditional phonics begins with the alphabet and one sound for each
letter, which are then blended together to sound out words. In Lesson 1,
Orton teaches the sound of short a and five consonants, which are then
used to practice blending sounds into words. Lesson 1 includes three
sentences with words such as fat, Sam, mat, bat, sat, made with three
“sight” words, I, on, had. This method needs little explanation to
those familiar with traditional phonics.

<h5>The Spalding (WRTR) Method</h5>

The Spalding method is quite complex, so I have summarized it in five steps:

<h4>

  Classical Phonics, Second Edition $16.95
</h4>

Classical Phonics is a deceptively simple little book our teachers
and families use constantly in both kindergarten and first grade. It
consists of phonetically arranged word lists for students to practice
their growing phonics skills. In a word list there are no context clues,
so the learner must rely on his mastery of letter sounds. For instance,
if your child can pronounce each word in this list correctly—pot, pat,
pit, put, pet—he knows his short vowel sounds, and you can move on
to long vowels! If not, he needs more practice, and Classical Phonics
is the most effective tool we know of to address the repetition that
young ones need when learning to read. Classical Phonics can be used
as a supplement to any phonics program, and covers nearly all English
phonograms and sounds taught through second grade. Classical Phonics is
your handy tool for phonics practice and for building confident readers.

  What Is the Classical Approach to Phonics? By Cheryl Lowe
</h3>

There have been two answers to this last question in the classical
education movement. On the one hand, there are those who believe
that The Writing Road to Reading (WRTR), by Romalda Spalding, is the
true classical approach and everything else could best be described as
“phonics lite.” On the other hand, the leading publishing companies
in the movement <b>Veritas Press, Memoria Press, and Peace Hill Press</b> do
not use the Spalding method, and in fact, all have written their own
phonics programs.

I submit that the Spalding method is so unique that the first division
of phonics programs in the homeschooling world is between Spalding-type
programs and everything else. Everything else I think can accurately be
described as traditional phonics. Which is the better approach, or are
they both equally effective? I will describe each and then provide a
comparison in order to give the reader the tools to answer this question.

First, let’s look at traditional phonics, from which there are many
programs to choose. It is true that each has a slightly different emphasis
and different bells and whistles. Some are written for the homeschooling
mother in an informal setting; some are written for the classroom. Some
include printing instruction; some do not. Some phonics programs continue
on for the whole of elementary school and include spelling and grammar;
others just cover the basics. Some teach vowel-consonant blending and
others consonant-vowel blending. Some have lots of songs, jingles, and
fun activities; others are bare bones. Some are remedial; others are
accelerated. A few have special marking systems. But with few exceptions,
they all use some version of the traditional scope and sequence so they
can all be classified as traditional.

What are the characteristics of traditional phonics that all of these
programs have in common?

Classical Phonics: A Child’s Guide to Word Mastery is based on the
1913 book, Word Mastery, by Florence Akin. Akin’s simple approach to
teaching phonics was updated with more modern illustrations, reorganized,
and slightly expanded. It is similar in concept to Noah Webster’s
Reading Handbook from Christian Liberty Press.

<h5>Review by Michelle Way</h5>

My five-year-old son loves this book and so do I! I've researched and
experimented with several phonics/reading programs, books, etc. but I
think this is the best of them all. I really appreciate the simplicity
of the lessons - no frills, bells or whistles - just solid phonics
teaching. On a side note, many children struggle with b, d, p and q in
the beginning stages of reading. The beauty of this book is that there
are multiple opportunities in each lesson for the child to practice
recognizing these letters. This book is so user-friendly for both
teacher and child. I'm using this along with the McGuffey Eclectic
Primer and am so encouraged by the progress my son is making. I wish I
would have had this book when I taught my older son to read because it
is just SO wonderful. I think this little gem belongs in every home and
school. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!

<h5>MONA'S CLOSING COMMENT</h5>

Don’t give up on common sense. How many teachers have felt that look-say
was not working and raised their heads above the parapet only to be shot
down by conforming LEAs? Teacher training and LEAs are to blame for 95%
of today’s failure, - and STILL politicians trust them! Chris Woodhead
truly said that education is “ a heavily policed thought world”, and
the LEAs do most of the policing. They hold many carrots, many sticks
to give or withhold funds and promotion. Parents and strugglers have
nowhere to turn. Education is specifically excluded from the brief of
the Ombudsman. I tried to use the council’s complaints procedure and
got a reply from…. the LEA !

And still “professional learning” is made to sound good! Do teachers
really need “continuing professional development” in such simple
fields? Just let in common sense!

How many teachers, passionate, hard-working, have quit teaching because
their pupils fail? They have followed their (mis)training, done their
best, and they just get dreary hours of failure.

Literacy is the rising tide that lifts all ships. Even at the OLMOS (1
letter- 1 sound) stage, no end of names in an atlas can be read: India,
Atlantic, Popocatepetl (and let the lesson wander off into geography,
volcanoes…). This gives a point to learning to read for LIFE! You
can make Bingo for names of fruit, animals, football teams, countries,
rivers/mountains, cities, plants. A very popular one (to my surprise)
is cooking ingredients. In contrast, pop groups fell flat!

<h5>About</h5>

When I taught my daughter to read back in 2004, I was guided by Mona
McNee's Step By Step, daily phonics reading programme. I had previously
taught my two sons to read using the same scheme. Deciding to update my
resource materials I spent a lot of time creating games and worksheets
shamelessly modelled on those featured in the book. It was always my
intention to share these PDF documents. In the summer of 2010 work began
on phonics4free.org. Shortly after I established contact with Mona to
discuss sharing the sheets. Mona was taken with the idea. Since then she
has very generously contributed her resources, expertise and guidance
to help  establish phonics4free.org as a number one reading resource.

  Noah Webster's Spelling Book Method for Teaching Reading and Spelling Paperback by Mr. Donald L. Potter
</h3>

It is a little known fact that reading was taught by means of spelling
for over 200 years. Today the impact of spelling on reading achievement
is not as well appreciated as it once was. The late Dr. Ronald P. Carver
did extensive research into the causal relationships between spelling
instruction and reading ability. Carver concluded, "One very important way
to learn how to pronounce more words accurately is sometimes overlooked,
that is, learning to spell more words accurately." (Causes of High and
Low Reading Achievement, p. 178). He also notes that "spelling was used
to teach reading for almost 200 years, but by the beginning of the 20th
century, the tide had so turned that learning to spell was largely seen as
incidental to learning to read." Quoting C. A. Perfetti, Carver observed,
"practice at spelling should help reading more than practice of reading
helps spelling." (p. 179. In June of 2004 Miss Geraldine Rodgers sent
me her essay, "Why Noah Webster's Way Was the Right Way." She argued
from the history of reading and the psychology of reading that Webster's
spelling book method of teaching reading and spelling was superior to all
other methods. I was surprised to learn that that Webster, in his 1828
American Dictionary of the English Language, defined a Spelling Book as,
" A book for teaching children to spell and read." He also wrote under
the entry, Spelling, "To tell the name of letters of a word, with a proper
division of syllables, for the purpose of learning the pronunciation. In
this manner children learn to read by first spelling the words." You can
see that Webster was quite clear about the dual purpose of the spelling
books in his day. You can imagine my surprise at the improvement I
began to get with my tutoring students when they started working through
Webster's Spelling Book. I decided to type up my own edition to use in my
private tutoring and my tutoring work at the Odessa Christian School in
Odessa, TX, where I teach remedial reading and Spanish. In this edition,
I have retained everything in the original 1908 (descendant from the
1829 edition). The only differences relate to formatting. I chose to
list the words in rows instead of columns. I also allow the words to
divide at the ends of lines. I have found that this works fine for all
students. We are teaching students to read and spell by syllables and
not by word shapes or context. When reading and spelling are taught by
the Spelling Book Method, all guessing at words from shape or context
is completely eliminated. The student's total focus is on pronouncing
the words correctly, high levels of comprehension are a natural result.

  First Readers Anthology: Samuel L. Blumenfeld's Phonics Readers - Don Potter
</h4>

The First Readers Anthology is a collection of phonics readers
(phonetically decodable texts) that were originally published in 1997 as
eleven individually stapled booklets to be used with popular Blumenfeld's
Alpha-Phonics Reading Primer. The reading levels progress from beginning
to upper elementary, virtually covering all the major spelling patterns
of the English language. They encourage the development of fluent decoding
and good comprehension. They can be used with any phonics reading program
that starts with the short vowels. These are the readers to use if want
children to read well without guessing from pictures or sight-words.

<h5>Review by Mssr. Nomdeplume</h5>

This book has two parts: the first part, written as a letter to Johnny's
mother, explains the failings of adopting the See-And-Say method of
teaching reading in American schools, and the second part outlines a very
thorough and practical phonics method via word charts for reading mastery.

  70 Basic Phonogram Cards By: Wanda Sanseri
</h3>

The English language is made up of 45 sounds which we spell in
approximately 70 ways. A phonogram is a letter or set of letters used to
represent one or more of these 45 sounds. The quickest, most natural way
to learn to spell and to read the English language is to begin by learning
the 70 foundational phonograms. The packet contains cards for each of
these. The front of the card contains the phonogram in isolation. The
back of each card gives the teacher all the information she needs to
teach the phonogram. These cards should be used in conjunction with
"Teaching Reading at Home".

</h4>

Reading Made Easy with Blend Phonics for First Grade was first published
in 1980 by Hazel Logan Loring, who had taught it for many years in her
first grade classes. It features instruction in directional guidance,
which helps prevent reversals in reading. It has also proven very valuable
in helping older students with reading problems. The accompanying
Blend Phonics Fluency Drills were written by Mr. Donald L. Potter to
help students to develop high levels of decoding fluency (accuracy and
speed). The Fluency Drills have proven particularly valuable in helping
struggling readers to overcome the whole-word guessing habit and improve
reading efficiency.

  Dr. Orton's Great Discovery by Sam Blumenfeld 
</h3>

In fact, Orton was the first modern neuropathologist to recognize the
harm that the new whole-word, or sight-word method, of teaching reading
was having on children. He had studied cases of reading disability in
Iowa in the late 1920s, and came to the conclusion that the cause of
the children’s problems was this new teaching method.

Orton was not the first person to recognize this problem. It was first
written about in 1844 by Samuel Stillman Greene (1810-1883) on behalf of
the Boston Masters for their famous Remarks on the Seventh Annual Report
of the Honorable Horace Mann, Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of
Education, in which they took to task the sight-reading method that had
been adopted by the Boston primary schools in 1837 and produced a literacy
disaster. And it was this critical essay that revealed who originated
this new method of teaching reading: the Rev. Thomas H. Gallaudet,
the director of the American Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb in Hartford,
Connecticut, who taught the deaf to read via a sight method and thought
that this method could be adapted for use by normal children.

...

Today we know why this new sight-word method caused a literacy
disaster. It forced children to use the right brain to perform the
functions of the left brain (the site of the language faculty), which
actually deforms the child’s brain, causing dyslexia. In fact, the
sight method acts as a non-surgical pre-frontal lobotomy. However,
since that portion of the brain is not actually physically removed,
it can be repaired according to the latest findings of neuroscientists,
revealing the brain‘s great plasticity..

However, in 1929, no one seemed to have read what the Boston Masters wrote
in 1844. And as we know, when we ignore or forget history we are bound
to repeat it. Not only was Dr. Orton unaware of what had been written
in 1844, but educators of today are not aware of what Dr. Orton wrote
in 1929. He said in as diplomatic way as possible:

...

What is most critical is that Orton, in this essay, identified
sight-reading methods as “faulty teaching methods,” actually accusing
America’s top educators, who were responsible for propagating this new
teaching method, as engaging in a form of educational malpractice. And
that is why this article was never given the circulation it should have
had. Indeed, the Journal of Educational Psychology was owned and edited
by the very professors Orton was criticizing. And they saw to it that
it never became widely known.

...

But there is one large group of educators in America aware of this
problem: the homeschoolers, who almost universally use intensive phonics
to teach their children to read.
