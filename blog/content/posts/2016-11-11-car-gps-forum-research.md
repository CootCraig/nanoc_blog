### <a href="http://www8.garmin.com/products/poiloader/creating_custom_poi_files.jsp" target="_blank">garmin.com - Creating Custom POI Files</a>

Advanced users can create their own .csv and .gpx files that contain
Custom POIs (points of interest) for use on compatible Garmin devices
with MP3 players. Both .csv and .gpx files are loaded to the device
using the Garmin POI Loader application. After processing the files,
POI Loader uploads a single file called Poi.gpi to the device.

But did you know you can go back and view 200,000 points worth of
data? Well, it’s all there, under Garmin/GPX/Archive.

<em>Question:</em>  What is a trip log and how does it work on a nuvi
or zumo device?

<em>Answer:</em> Trip logs are points automatically stored when the GPS
device is locked onto a satellite signal and moving. It is the electronic
equivalent of laying down a "breadcrumb trail" to mark the path that
has been traveled.

Your nuvi or zumo can store 10,000 points before it begins the process
of archiving additional logs.* Beyond 10,000 points the device moves the
oldest trip data into an internal archive file. Up to 20 archive files
can be stored internally on the unit. This means, depending on space
available, that the device can store over 200,000 points of trip data.
