Army of Evil Robots is a collaborative effort between designer/multi-media
artist Helen Highwater and über nerd Derek Anderson. We build robots
that build robots that turn evil and build awesome things.

We currently have 2 CNCs; our littlest CNC named Andre, with a 4 inch
by 6 inch cutting area and Big Ben, which Derek built December 2011,
with a 4 ft by 4 ft cutting area.

A CNC is a Computer Numeric Controlled machine that cuts out whatever
shape you program it to. Occasionally they can malfunction, reset to
the default evil robot BIOS and develop self awareness.

Derek’s latest additions the our robot family are his amazing 3D
printers.

We’ve built several projects over the past year such as signage,
furniture, strange creatures and more.


### Clock finally finished, and a new filament for the 3D printer!
