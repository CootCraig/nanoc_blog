Noah realized that England and the new United States had different
forms of government, institutions, customs and laws. Because of this,
he believed that they needed different vocabularies. He also knew that
science and technology were developing rapidly, and new words were
being introduced just as quickly. So, he spent over 25 years researching
words and their origins and writing the first American dictionary. This
dictionary helped Americans to feel pride in their new country, and
enabled everyone across the new nation to have a standard vocabulary.

Webster's greatest achievement was the dictionary. In 1800 he published
his intentions of writing a dictionary. He published a shortened, concise
but comprehensive, version in 1806. The final version was finished in 1825
and published in 1828. It contained 70,000 words. It is no exaggeration
to say that it was immediately accepted as the greatest dictionary of the
English language on both sides of the Atlantic. Webster had an absolute
genius for defining words.
