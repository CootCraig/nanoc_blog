R. Austin Freeman (1862–1943) was a British author of detective
stories. A pioneer of the inverted detective story, in which the
reader knows from the start who committed the crime, Freeman is
best known as the creator of the "medical jurispractitioner" Dr. John
Thorndyke. First introduced in The Red Thumb Mark (1907), the brilliant
forensic investigator went on to star in dozens of novels and short
stories over the next decades.

Richard Austin Freeman (11 April 1862 – 28 September 1943) was a
British writer of detective stories, mostly featuring the medico-legal
forensic investigator Dr. Thorndyke. He claimed to have invented the
inverted detective story (a crime fiction in which the commission of the
crime is described at the beginning, usually including the identity of
the perpetrator, with the story then describing the detective's attempt
to solve the mystery). Freeman used some of his early experiences as a
colonial surgeon in his novels.
