#### [Armadillo.cc is a source of free, Creative Commons-licensed audio](http://armadillo.cc/)

#### [freesound.org](http://www.freesound.org/browse/)

Freesound aims to create a huge collaborative database of audio snippets,
samples, recordings, bleeps, ... released under Creative Commons licenses
that allow their reuse. Freesound provides new and interesting ways of
accessing these samples, allowing users to:

* browse the sounds in new ways using keywords, a "sounds-like" type of browsing and more
* upload and download sounds to and from the database, under the same creative commons license
* interact with fellow sound-artists!

#### [archive.org audio](https://archive.org/details/audio)

This library contains recordings ranging from alternative news
programming, to Grateful Dead concerts, to Old Time Radio shows, to book
and poetry readings, to original music uploaded by our users. Many of
these audios and MP3s are available for free download.
