  Serial Numbers & Dates - How Old is My Bike?
</h4>

Unfortunately, exactly dating a Peugeot earlier than the late 1970s is
an art rather than a science, and is often an estimate at best.  Even
original owners have a hard time remembering the year that they purchased
the bicycle.  That said, it is possible to date a bike within a couple
of years with some confidence based on frame features and components.
See the 'Frames, Headbadges and Decals' webpage for a pictorial timeline
of frame features, and the 'Parts & Accessories' webpage for information
on when specific components were found on 'U' bicycles.

  Nafeez Ahmed: Our Systems Are Failing This is an evolutionary moment for our species by Adam Taggart
</h4>

Dr. Nafeez Ahmed is an award winning 15 year investigative journalist,
noted international security scholar, best-selling author and film-maker.
He authored The Guardian’s Earth Insight blog and has twice won
the prestigious Project Censored Award for outstanding investigative
journalism.

In his new book Failing States, Collapsing Systems, Nafeez points out,
as we often do here at PeakProsperity.com, that everything in our modern
society is connected to energy, and that our pursuit of ever more, ever
higher growth is finally colliding with planetary limits. Scarcity and
strife will be the dominant trends from here, unless we, as a species,
start looking for different ways of living better-suited for a finite
world:

  Everything I Want To Do Is Illegal: War Stories from the Local Food Front by Joel Salatin

<h4>
  <a href="http://www.polyfacefarms.com/" target="_blank">Welcome to Polyface, Inc.</a>
</h4>

In 1961, William and Lucille Salatin moved their young family to
Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley, purchasing the most worn-out, eroded,
abused farm in the area near Staunton. Using nature as a pattern, they
and their children began the healing and innovation that now supports
three generations.

Disregarding conventional wisdom, the Salatins planted trees, built
huge compost piles, dug ponds, moved cows daily with portable electric
fencing, and invented portable sheltering systems to produce all their
animals on perennial prairie polycultures.

Today the farm arguably represents America’s premier non-industrial
food production oasis. Believing that the Creator’s design is still
the best pattern for the biological world, the Salatin family invites
like-minded folks to join in the farm’s mission: to develop emotionally,
economically, environmentally enhancing agricultural enterprises and
facilitate their duplication throughout the world.

BaileyLineRoad.com is an unusual website and that’s why it takes a
little explaining. It’s named after the rural road where I live on
Manitoulin Island, Canada, and this website is a window into my varied,
hands-on, modern homesteading life. One morning I might be earning some
money at my laptop creating an article, video or how-to course.  By the
afternoon I could be working with cattle on our small farm. The next day
I might be working on a building or shingling a roof. Then there’s
always machinery to be maintained and repaired, gardens to be worked,
or a lake to swim in. All of this is what happens down at the end of
the real Bailey Line Road. Entertaining and enlightening you is what
this site is all about.

On a personal level, I’ve been writing, taking photos, making videos,
building furniture, houses and working with stone for more than 30 years.

  Mining CEO explains why silver could reach $136.67 by Simon Black May 8, 2017
</h4>

The real investment thesis about silver is that it’s a precious metal
that has industrial qualities and a long-standing tradition of value.

Like gold, silver was an ancient form of money. And for good reason.

Between the two, gold is obviously more rare… hence the higher price.

There’s an old estimate from the US Geological Survey from the late
1960s suggesting that the ratio of silver to gold in the earth’s crust
is about 21:1.

(So assuming that’s true, the theoretical price ratio between the two
should be around 21:1)

And in ancient times the price ratio between the two metals was frequently
in the range of about 15:1, i.e. one ounce of gold was worth 15 ounces
of silver.

Today the ratio is about 75, based on a gold price of about $1230 per
ounce, and a silver price of $16.35.

This is fairly high even by modern standards as the long-term average
over the past several decades is about 50.

This would suggest that silver should in increase in price relative to
gold in order for the ratio to return to its historic average.

(A ratio of 50:1 would imply a silver price of $24.60 based on a gold
price of $1230.)

Now, all of this is an argument that many of us have heard before.

But I did learn something over the weekend from the mining CEO; he told
us that the current mining production ratio between the two metals is
about 9:1.

This means that 9 ounces of silver are mined for every 1 ounce of gold
that’s mined.

  The United States Is Hosting A Debt Party – $2,000 Gold Is Coming - by Palisade Research May 8, 2017
</h4>

<p>
In 2014, debt over took GDP for the first since post-World
War II. Unfortunately for the United States, it is no longer the
world’s only superpower. After WW2, the US was the beneficiary of
having its infrastructure unscathed, and was essentially the world’s
manufacturer. The baby boomers benefited immensely, with low tax rates
and generous pensions.
</p>

<p>
For every dollar of GDP growth, we are adding $1-2 dollars in debt!

  The Myth of the Rule of Law by Robert Taylor 05/07/2017
</h4>

<p>
Any state, no matter how powerful, cannot not rule solely through the
use of brute force. There are too few rulers and too many of us for
coercion alone to be an effective means of control. The political class
must rely on ideology to achieve popular compliance, masking the iron
fist in a velvet glove. Violence is always behind every state action,
but the most efficient form of expropriation occurs when the public
believes it is in their interest to be extorted.
</p>

<p>
Before the rise of legislative law, the private, decentralized, and
polycentric common-law system was effective at promoting peace and public
order because it lacked the monopoly power of a centralized state. Under
both models, laws are never determinate or universally objective. But
under a private law system, bad decisions that were not accepted by
the public or viewed as overreaches could not be coercively imposed on
society. This system of checks and balances allowed laws beneficial to the
protection of private property to flourish while weeding out the bad laws.
</p>

<p>
Under a state system, however, it is much harder, if not impossible,
to fix bad laws as there now exists a political incentive to keep the
law on the books, while most judges serve lengthy or even life terms. If
the judge, legislature, and police are all part of the state apparatus,
they will tend to find expansive definitions for state power with limited
definitions of individual freedoms.
</p>

<p>
“The myth of the rule of law does more than render the people submissive
to state authority; it also turns them into the state’s accomplices in
the exercise of its power,” concludes Hasnas. “For people who would
ordinarily consider it a great evil to deprive individuals of their
rights or oppress politically powerless minority groups will respond
with patriotic fervor when these same actions are described as upholding
the rule of law.” While the state does indeed provide some law and
order under its jurisdiction, the “rule of law” has been used as a
propaganda tool in order to help cement and legitimize state power.

  What's Killing the Middle Class? (Part 1) by charles hugh smith Sunday, May 07, 2017
</h4>

<p>
So what's killing the middle class? If you read the dozens of articles
on the decline of the middle class in the mainstream (corporate) media,
you soon discover there's a short list of the usual suspects:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Globalization / outsourcing</li>
  <li>Technological changes / automation</li>
  <li>"Winner take all" asymmetry in rewards for specialized skills</li>
</ol>

<p>
Skills that are non-tradable and scarce will command high
compensation. Skills /credentials that are tradable and abundant are
a dime a dozen--there is no pricing power to labor that's abundant,
tradable and interchangeable (i.e. a commodity).

  The Meaning of Kinda-Sorta Obamacare Repeal and Replace By Christopher Chantrill
</h4>

<p>
Okay, so the House passed a “repeal and replace” ObamaCare bill. And it doesn’t really repeal ObamaCare and doesn’t really replace it.
</p>

<p>
More important, does this even begin to deal with the problem of the “ratchet effect,” the notion, publicized by Margaret Thatcher’s people, that it is almost impossible to undo the latest entitlement program?
</p>

<p>
The facts on the ground are that the majority of Americans want big government and its benefits. That is just the way that most people think. It is also, of course, the way our children are taught to think when incarcerated throughout their childhood in government child-custodial facilities.
</p>

<p>
But will there ever be an America where most people don’t want free stuff from government and instead get their kicks from telling the politicians and the activists to put it where the sun don’t shine?
</p>

<p>
I doubt it. And so, all hail ObamaCare-lite, because that’s the best we can get.
</p>

<p>
The result of lusting after free stuff, unfortunately, is Venezuela. But we can kick the habit way before that, right?
