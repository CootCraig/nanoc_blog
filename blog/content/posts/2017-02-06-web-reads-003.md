  Serial Numbers & Dates - How Old is My Bike?
</h4>

Unfortunately, exactly dating a Peugeot earlier than the late 1970s is
an art rather than a science, and is often an estimate at best.  Even
original owners have a hard time remembering the year that they purchased
the bicycle.  That said, it is possible to date a bike within a couple
of years with some confidence based on frame features and components.
See the 'Frames, Headbadges and Decals' webpage for a pictorial timeline
of frame features, and the 'Parts & Accessories' webpage for information
on when specific components were found on 'U' bicycles.

  Nafeez Ahmed: Our Systems Are Failing This is an evolutionary moment for our species by Adam Taggart
</h4>

Dr. Nafeez Ahmed is an award winning 15 year investigative journalist,
noted international security scholar, best-selling author and film-maker.
He authored The Guardianâ€™s Earth Insight blog and has twice won
the prestigious Project Censored Award for outstanding investigative
journalism.

In his new book Failing States, Collapsing Systems, Nafeez points out,
as we often do here at PeakProsperity.com, that everything in our modern
society is connected to energy, and that our pursuit of ever more, ever
higher growth is finally colliding with planetary limits. Scarcity and
strife will be the dominant trends from here, unless we, as a species,
start looking for different ways of living better-suited for a finite
world:
