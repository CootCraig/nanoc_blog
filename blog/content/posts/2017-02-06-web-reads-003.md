  Serial Numbers & Dates - How Old is My Bike?
</h4>

Unfortunately, exactly dating a Peugeot earlier than the late 1970s is
an art rather than a science, and is often an estimate at best.  Even
original owners have a hard time remembering the year that they purchased
the bicycle.  That said, it is possible to date a bike within a couple
of years with some confidence based on frame features and components.
See the 'Frames, Headbadges and Decals' webpage for a pictorial timeline
of frame features, and the 'Parts & Accessories' webpage for information
on when specific components were found on 'U' bicycles.

  Nafeez Ahmed: Our Systems Are Failing This is an evolutionary moment for our species by Adam Taggart
</h4>

Dr. Nafeez Ahmed is an award winning 15 year investigative journalist,
noted international security scholar, best-selling author and film-maker.
He authored The Guardian’s Earth Insight blog and has twice won
the prestigious Project Censored Award for outstanding investigative
journalism.

In his new book Failing States, Collapsing Systems, Nafeez points out,
as we often do here at PeakProsperity.com, that everything in our modern
society is connected to energy, and that our pursuit of ever more, ever
higher growth is finally colliding with planetary limits. Scarcity and
strife will be the dominant trends from here, unless we, as a species,
start looking for different ways of living better-suited for a finite
world:

  Everything I Want To Do Is Illegal: War Stories from the Local Food Front by Joel Salatin

</h4>

In 1961, William and Lucille Salatin moved their young family to
Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley, purchasing the most worn-out, eroded,
abused farm in the area near Staunton. Using nature as a pattern, they
and their children began the healing and innovation that now supports
three generations.

Disregarding conventional wisdom, the Salatins planted trees, built
huge compost piles, dug ponds, moved cows daily with portable electric
fencing, and invented portable sheltering systems to produce all their
animals on perennial prairie polycultures.

Today the farm arguably represents America’s premier non-industrial
food production oasis. Believing that the Creator’s design is still
the best pattern for the biological world, the Salatin family invites
like-minded folks to join in the farm’s mission: to develop emotionally,
economically, environmentally enhancing agricultural enterprises and
facilitate their duplication throughout the world.

BaileyLineRoad.com is an unusual website and that’s why it takes a
little explaining. It’s named after the rural road where I live on
Manitoulin Island, Canada, and this website is a window into my varied,
hands-on, modern homesteading life. One morning I might be earning some
money at my laptop creating an article, video or how-to course.  By the
afternoon I could be working with cattle on our small farm. The next day
I might be working on a building or shingling a roof. Then there’s
always machinery to be maintained and repaired, gardens to be worked,
or a lake to swim in. All of this is what happens down at the end of
the real Bailey Line Road. Entertaining and enlightening you is what
this site is all about.

On a personal level, I’ve been writing, taking photos, making videos,
building furniture, houses and working with stone for more than 30 years.
