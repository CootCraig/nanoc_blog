Ansible is an open-source software platform for configuring and managing
computers. It combines multi-node software deployment, ad hoc task
execution, and configuration management. It manages nodes over SSH
and requires Python (2.4 or later)  to be installed on them. Modules
work over JSON and standard output and can be written in any programming
language. The system uses YAML to express reusable descriptions of
systems.

Playbooks express configurations, deployment, and orchestration in
Ansible. The Playbook format is YAML. Each Playbook maps a group of
hosts to a set of roles. Each role is represented by calls to Ansible
call tasks.

Ansible is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your
applications and systems easier to deploy. Avoid writing scripts or
custom code to deploy and update your applicationsâ€” automate in a
language that approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents to
install on remote systems.

### [Ansible - What Version To Pick?](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html#what-version-to-pick)

If you are wishing to run the latest released version of Ansible and
you are running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (TM), CentOS, Fedora, Debian,
or Ubuntu, we recommend using the OS package manager.

On the managed nodes, you only need Python 2.4 or later, but if you are
running less than Python 2.5 on the remotes, you will also need:

* python-simplejson
