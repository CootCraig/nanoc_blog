King Post Roof Trusses are the most cost effective truss, and they look
great when curved braces and webs are used. A king post truss solves
many structural problems as well. Its bottom chord acts as a ‘tie’
for the room, holding the walls from spreading.

In the South, a king post roof truss may be able to span 36 feet with 16
foot spacing, where the same truss in a snow belt up north may only be
able to span 24 feet with the same spacing. We size all of our truss
members for the exact region where they are being installed and we
provide detailed shop drawings with a structural engineer’s stamp.

The Brigham Hill Farm is in Massachusetts. Vermont Timber Works
constructed a rough-sawn, white-pine and hemlock timber frame for
the farm.

##### Scissor Truss Frames

A type of common purlin frame that uses diagonal, crossing ties that
span from eave posts to the opposite rafters. The struts of the truss
provide a number of advantages: they transfer loads more efficiently
to the eave posts, reduce the thrust at the eave wall, and allow for a
greater span than rafters alone.

A timber roof truss is a structural framework of timbers designed to
bridge the space above a room and to provide support for a roof. Trusses
usually occur at regular intervals, linked by longitudinal timbers such
as purlins. The space between each truss is known as a bay.[1]
