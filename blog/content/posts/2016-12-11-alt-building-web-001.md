The Complete Yurt Handbook Paperback by Paul King

Paul King -
Woodland Yurts is a small family business. Every yurt is individually
hand crafted to the customer's specification. We have been making yurts
for more than 20 years and have perfected our designs over this time. I
have studied yurt making in Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan. In recent years we
have moved to a large new workshop and invested in high quality machinery
and tooling to make our yurts consistently the best avaialble.
