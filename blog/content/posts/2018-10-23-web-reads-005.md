  EXAMINING JESUS’ INCLUSION OF WORK ROLES IN HIS PARABLES Klaus Issler, PhD
</h4>

Instead, Jesus was sovereignly assigned to an ordinary couple, Mary
and Joseph, who worked in a “secular” trade.  After returning from
their brief sojourn in Egypt, Jesus’ family moved north to Galilee, a
couple of day’s journey from Jerusalem. During his young adult years,
Jesus lived far away from the temple precincts, devoting his days to
getting his hands dirty with building materials as a “blue collar”
construction worker.  That may seem remarkable in light of a commonly held
view today that deems secular work as of lower value than “full time
vocational ministry.” Yet by taking a deeper look at Jesus’ teachings
and his own “secular” work experience prior to his public ministry,
we may come to appreciate how this form of work had a significant role
in Jesus’ life, and how it continues to have a vital role in God’s
ongoing work today.

  Get Your DVD Box Set of “Western Heritage” Today
</h3>

The story of the West is really a story about us. By learning about
our Western roots, we are studying the greatest thinkers of the past to
understand high ideas like freedom and virtue. These ideas shape us. They
add meaning and purpose to our lives and relationships with others. They
make us human.

If we lose these ideas—if we fail to understand our Western
Heritage—the cost will be high. We risk becoming what twentieth-century
theologian C.S. Lewis called, “trousered apes”—half-hearted
creatures in khakis and button-downs that lack full humanity and are
content with the spirit of this age.

That’s why every Hillsdale student is required to take this course
before graduation and why we offer “Western Heritage” for free. We see
firsthand what difference this education makes on our campus. But we know
there are even more people who need to learn about the incredible story
of Western civilization, and wrestle with these great ideas and thinkers.

Now you can get Hillsdale’s online course, “Western Heritage—From
the Book of Genesis to John Locke,” in this beautiful DVD box set for
viewing in your home or in a small group. You might also find it useful
for homeschool curriculum or for personal study. Do you know someone
who is unfamiliar with this subject, or who wants to know more? This
DVD would make a perfect gift for them!

  Off Grid Winch: Making a Flip Flop Winch
</h3>

I first discovered this ingenious flip-flop winch from a YouTube
demonstration by Mors Kochanski, the Godfather of bushcraft. A search
of flip-flop winches on YT will garner several clips demonstrating the
power of using two logs and some rope. So why would I add my video to
mix? Because it's only theory until you put it into action by Doing

  The Bride of Frankenstein
</h3>

However, it is in The Bride of Frankenstein that Henry – and the
story itself – ponders the moral implications of playing God, or
defying God, by creating life. Henry is tortured by the thought of what
he has done…and this is more than many horror movies would dare to
discuss. Horror is usually meant as a release, for the audience to sit
and be scared, only to know they are innocent and that the bad guy will
be defeated at the end. Few horror movies truly explore the grey areas of
morality, and The Bride of Frankenstein is one of those rare exceptions
that does so.

This is also why the movie provides far more blatant Christian symbolism
and parallels than seen in the first film. Neither James Whale nor
William Hurlbut were devout Christians, and yet the Christian imagery is
obvious all throughout the movie. The Monster is captured by villagers
and raised up on a pole in an unmistakably Christ-like crucifixion; the
crucifix shines down on the blind hermit and the Monster as they meet
and become friends; it is there again, observing as the Monster descends
into the earth and enters the crypt where he meets Dr. Pretorius; and of
course Dr. Pretorius openly and cheerfully compares himself to the Devil,
as he has his own reasons for wanting to create life from lifelessness.

Much more than in the original, The Bride of Frankenstein plays with
this question and shows us the consequences of mortal men daring to
tread into the realm of the Divine. The original film opened the door,
but this film basks in it. As Henry Frankenstein states, "…For what
a wonderful vision it was! I dreamed of being the first to give to the
world the secret that God is so jealous of." Why else would Old Scratch,
the Devil himself – in the guise of Dr. Pretorius – show up at
Henry's door and demand to see him, even as speaks these words to his
wife while he recovers – recovering from his redemption, as he thought
he had repented for his sins?

The movie makes it plain that Pretorius, not the Monster, is the true
villain of the piece. He shows Henry his connection of "homunculi,"
little people he had created himself, growing "naturally" rather
than using Frankenstein's method. I've pondered the point of this
entire sequence – why does the movie spend so much time showing us
these little people in jars, then put them away so we never see them
again? In some ways, it could be said Pretorius is playing God when
he makes these little creatures. He creates a Queen first – in much
the same way he wants to create a Bride. The King is created in the
manner and image of Henry VIII. Strangely enough, only a year before
filming this movie, Elsa Lanchester's husband, Charles Laughton, had
portrayed Henry VIII in an immortal film role himself. Could this be
an intentional in-joke of the film? It's certainly possible. Meanwhile,
we also see a bored Bishop – more Christian imagery – and a dancer,
apparently sweet and innocent. And finally, of course, the Devil…and
it is here that Pretorius blatantly and clearly identifies himself with
the Devil, relishing and embracing the role as he says, "l took a great
deal of pains with him. Sometimes I have wondered whether life wouldn't
be much more amusing if we were all devils, and no nonsense about angels
and being good." (It's also worth taking a moment to praise the special
effects of this sequence, arguably the best seen in any Hollywood film
at all up to that point…and even for a long time after.)

Which brings up the role of the Monster himself…finally. This is
a monster movie starring a rampaging Monster, right? Yet we've been
discussing it so long, we've barely touched on the Monster himself. The
Monster grows up in this movie, finds a friend, learns to speak, seeks a
mate, and finally ends himself (and the evil Dr. Pretorius) in the final
scene, blowing up the entire laboratory. Boris Karloff was at the height
of his popularity here, and the movie emphasized this by simply crediting
him with the single name KARLOFF, all in capital letters. It's generally
agreed that this was indeed Karloff's greatest role. Karloff himself
objected to the Monster learning to speak, as he felt it more effective
for the Monster to remain mute. But, of course the Monster has to grow and
become something more than the character he was in the first movie. In
the original movie, he was an innocent babe, and the world was out to
destroy him regardless of his innocence. In The Bride of Frankenstein
he is no longer innocent. This is demonstrated at the very beginning,
as the first thing he does is kill two peasants in the wreckage of the
burning mill – and not just any two, but the very father and mother
of the girl who had drowned. (The Monster has passed through fire and
water, and thus he has been reborn.) No, the Monster is not innocent in
this movie. But, we have to see that despite this, he is still good. And
thus, his first act is to rescue a girl falling into the water, much like
what happened in the first movie. The Monster has learned what happened
before, so he saves the girl from drowning this time. He is no longer
the innocent babe of the first film. Thus, he has to learn how to talk,
as he becomes more intelligent and understanding of the world.

  Eschatology: End Times
</h3>

The term “eschatology” comes from two Greek terms escato and lovgo
meaning (roughly speaking) “last, end, or final” and “study of,”
respectively. Theologically speaking, then, the term eschatology refers
to “the study of final things” in the Bible. It concerns both personal
eschatological issues such as death and the intermediate state as well as
themes with a more general or corporate focus. The latter would include
such ideas as the return of Christ, resurrection, judgment, tribulation,
the millennial kingdom, and the eternal state.

  Christian eschatology
</h3>

Christian eschatology is a major branch of study within Christian theology
dealing with the "last things." Eschatology, from two Greek words meaning
"last" (ἔσχατος) and "study" (-λογία), is the study of 'end
things', whether the end of an individual life, the end of the age, the
end of the world and the nature of the Kingdom of God. Broadly speaking,
Christian eschatology is the study concerned with the ultimate destiny
of the individual soul and the entire created order, based primarily
upon biblical texts within the Old and New Testament.

Christian eschatology looks to study and discuss matters such as death
and the afterlife, Heaven and Hell, the Second Coming of Jesus, the
resurrection of the dead, the Rapture, the Tribulation, Millennialism,
the end of the world, the Last Judgment, and the New Heaven and New
Earth in the world to come. Eschatological passages are found in many
places in the Bible, both in the Old and the New Testaments. There are
also many extrabiblical examples of eschatological prophecies, as well
as church traditions.
