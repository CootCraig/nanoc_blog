## Dirk

generally 8-14 inches. However the Irish version often went as long as
21 inches in blade length.

The dirk was small and was carried everywhere the owner went. The dirk
was worn in plain view suspended from a belt at the waist.

Dirk is a Scots word for a long dagger; sometimes a cut-down sword blade
mounted on a dagger hilt, rather than a knife blade. The word dirk could
have possibly derived from the Gaelic word sgian dearg (red knife). It
may also have been a corruption of the Low German words Dulk or Dolk. The
shift from dearg to dirk is very minimal.

In Bronze Age and Iron Age Scotland and Ireland, the dirk was actually
considered to be a sword. Its blade length and style varied, but it is
generally 8-14 inches. However the Irish version often went as long as
21 inches in blade length.

Dirks were made with either double-edged or single-edged blades, and there
was no standard blade configuration. Reference books covering naval dirks
invariably show the popularity of both blade types. As a consequence,
historically there were about as many naval dirks mounting single-edged
blades as those with double-edged blades. Some dirks have single-edged
blades that also have a false edge near the tip, a feature that could
be useful in a backcut.

In medieval Scotland, the dirk was a backup to the broadsword, and
was wielded by the left hand while the scabbard was carried on the
arm. Dirks were used to swear an oath upon in Celtic cultures. After
the Battle of Culloden, the British government troops were aware that
the Highlanders normally swore on their dirks, so, to prevent future
uprisings or rebellions against the throne, they made them swear on oath
never to "possess any gun, sword, or pistol, or to use tartan: "... and
if I do so may I be cursed in my undertakings, family and property, may
I be killed in battle as a coward, and lie without burial in a strange
land, far from the graves of my forefathers and kindred; may all this
come across me if I break my oath." Nearly every Scottish male at the
time of the oath had a dirk. This was because most Scots were too poor
to buy a sword. The dirk was small and was carried everywhere the owner
went. The dirk was worn in plain view suspended from a belt at the waist.

Another shorter dagger tucked into a coat sleeve or stocking as part of
Highland dress is known as a Sgian Dubh, derived from the arm pit dagger
or sgian achlias. To this day, a real or false dirk is sometimes worn
as a part of traditional Scottish costume.
