Kee Lite Fittings

Kee Lite pipe and handrail fittings are structural pipe fittings made
from anodized aluminum. Kee Lite pipe fittings are about half the weight
of galvanized Kee Klamp fittings and have a clean, modern look. These
fittings can be used to build aluminum pipe railings and other pipe-based
structures.

Diamond Aluminum Company has been manufacturing structural aluminum slip
fittings in Ohio since 1957.

Diamond Aluminum produces strong lightweight structural slip on fittings
and provides schedule 40 aluminum pipe. The fittings and pipe combined
together are a very vestal building material and are a great alternative
to expensive and complex welding and pipe bending. With a few hours time,
a hex wrench and a hack saw one or two people can complete projects that
would take twice as long with other more traditional metal working. Our
products have been used all over the world in a variety of different
types of projects. From handrails at a local amusement park, to work
stands for recumbent trikes, and complex scaffolding used by military
aircraft designers and maintainers almost anything is possible.
