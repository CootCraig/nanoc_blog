  Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)
</h1>

Helicobacter pylori, previously Campylobacter pylori, is a gram-negative,
microaerophilic bacterium found usually in the stomach. It was identified
in 1982 by Australian scientists Barry Marshall and Robin Warren,
who found that it was present in a person with chronic gastritis and
gastric ulcers, conditions not previously believed to have a microbial
cause. It is also linked to the development of duodenal ulcers and
stomach cancer. However, over 80% of individuals infected with the
bacterium are asymptomatic, and it may play an important role in the
natural stomach ecology.

More than 50% of the world's population harbor H. pylori in their upper
gastrointestinal tract. Infection is more common in developing countries
than Western countries. H. pylori's helical shape (from which the genus
name derives) is thought to have evolved to penetrate the mucoid lining
of the stomach.

  Gastrointestinal Recovery After The Wheat Battle Is Won By Dr. Davis
</h3>

<h5>Among the most helpful and effective strategies to consider in your wheat removal efforts are:</h5>

Take a high-potency probiotic for at least several weeks, longer if
an autoimmune condition is present. 30-50 billion CFUs per day has
been working very well for us, especially brands with a wide variety
of Lactobacillus and Bidifobacteria species, such as 

<h5>VSL3, Renew Life, and Garden of Life brands.</h5>

Bowel flora are like a garden: probiotics are the seeds, prebiotics
are the water and fertilizer. If all you do is plant seeds, they may
sprout but not flourish, and may even die. So you must nourish your
plants. Likewise, you must nourish the bowel flora reinoculated by
your probiotic. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria love fibers that are
indigestible, what I call “leftovers,” what some call “resistant
starches.” Easy ways to obtain such fibers: one green unripe banana per
day in a smoothie, one peeled raw white potato in a smoothie, 4 teaspoons
of inulin in anything, small servings (1/4-1/2 cup) of legumes, chickpeas,
hummus. It is best to start with smaller quantities, then build up over
several weeks to avoid abdominal pain and bloating. I believe this issue
is Josie’s #1 problem. Note that relief from symptoms requires several
weeks to develop, not after your first green banana.

  SIBO vs. gut dysbiosis 	by cyclist 
</h3>

Which should be treated if a patient has both? 

SIBO treatment eliminates bacteria, but it would seem this would lead
to further dysbiosis and the potential for pathogenic species or yeast
to take over.

Treatment of gut dysbiosis typically includes prebiotics to feed
beneficial bacteria, but it would seem this would lead to further
overgrowth in the small intestine.

  Inulin and blood sugar by BirdmanSam
</h3>

<h4>Dr. Davis - Posted: 6/8/2015 7:38:47 PM</h4>

If a preparation of any prebiotic fiber is truly prebiotic fiber,
it should not raise blood sugar. Potato starch is dehydrated at a
temperature of 140 degrees Fahrenheit, meaning the heat converts some of
the prebiotic fibers to sugars, an imperfect process. For this reason,
we go lightly with the potato starch, just as you have done.

If the inulin preparation you are using is raising blood sugar, there
is something wrong with your specific preparation. It means changing
your preparation. What brand were you using?

Imbalances in the microbial community in your intestines may lead to
metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes. What does science say about
how to reset our bodies?
