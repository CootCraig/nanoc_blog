  How to Diagnose Electrical Ground Issues
</h3>

One of the best things you can do to help ensure a properly grounded
vehicle is to replace or add an engine-to-chassis ground strap; Taylor
makes a nice four-gauge, braided stainless steel strap ideal for most
vehicles.

If you are adding a number of accessories or ones that draw a large amount
of current, you should also replace the battery-to-chassis ground with a
larger gauge wire. That’s because the factory ground wire is usually
a less-than-adequate 10 or 12 gauge. A ground wire must be as large as
the positive, or supply, wire to the battery.

Hopefully you will never have to experience the joy of tracing a bad
ground. But if you find yourself in such a situation, these tips will
help make the job go smoother—and get your ride back on ground level.
