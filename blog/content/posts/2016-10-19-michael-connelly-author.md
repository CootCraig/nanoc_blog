<h2>The Poet by Michael Connelly</h2>

Read - Wed Oct 19 10:41:00 MDT 2016

Jack McEvoy specializes in death.  As a crime reporter for the Rocky
Mountain News, he has seen every kind of murder.  But his professional
bravado doesn’t lessen the brutal shock of learning that his only
brother is dead, a suicide.

Jack’s brother was a homicide detective, and he had been depressed
about a recent murder case, a hideously grisly one, that he’d been
unable to solve.

McEvoy decides that the best way to exorcise his grief is by writing a
feature on police suicides.  But when he begins his research, he quickly
arrives at a stunning revelation.  Following his leads, protecting his
sources, muscling his way inside a federal investigation, Jack grabs
hold of what is clearly the story of a lifetime.  He also knows that in
taking on the story, he’s making himself the most visible target for
a murderer who has eluded the greatest investigators alive.
