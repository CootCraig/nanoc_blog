<h4>Kelly Williams Hogan My favorite orders</h4>

McDonald's: "I'd like four plain quarter-pound meat patties. JUST the meat. And you can put all four in one box."

Hardee's: "I'd like your Monster Thickburger prepared with no bun and no lettuce. Just put it in a box, please."

Wendy's: "I'd like four of your large meat patties. Just the meat. And please put all four patties in one box."

<h4>Michelle Moss Worthy</h4>

McDonalds breakfast: I'd like 2 round eggs, 2 sausage patties, 2 cheese -
please stack them Sausage, Cheese, Egg (my preference) and 3 orders of
bacon (6 slices) and you can put it all in one box

<h4>Marcy Lilly</h4>

My hubby orders at McDonald's, 8-12 "1/4 pound meat patties only"

He also asks them to put them on a breakfast platter.

He always gives them the chance to hear him...many times they are so
trained to do it quickly they don't hear everything you say.

Hearing "cheeseburger" they ring up cheeseburger immediately.  Tell them
you want meat parties WITH cheese.

Or get the McDoubles and throw what you don't want out.

<h4>Kerry Nelson to Zero Carb Health</h4>

Lunch at Denny's ... 18 oz of burger with swiss. They were very
accommodating and helped me figure the lowest cost. 3 separate patties
would have been $6.+ each plus cheese, but, the waitress suggested
getting their double burger and add an extra patty.

My total cost including coffee and tax was just over $14 ... saved me
at least $6-8. Goes to show it really pays to talk to your waitstaff
and enlist their help 'cause my first choice of just ordering ala carte
would have cost me over $20 just for the burgers.

<h4>Kevin Fenderson</h4>

Denny's a la carte steak is pretty cheap. Their eggs are not. They also
will serve the steak really rare.

<h4>Shari Weiner</h4>

Steak 'N Shake Royale Steakburger: double bacon cheeseburger with pepper
jack cheese and an over easy egg on top. The mayo in the little cup may
have been Miracle Whip. It tasted sweet (and nasty) to me, so I skipped
it. The burger was delicious!

<h4>Lupe Guzman</h4>

When the family wants pizza I order mine meat lovers pizza no sauce
no crust

Yes pizza hut they look at me like.... what do you want??? And I tell
them a medium meat lover pizza no crust no sauce in a pasta plate hahaha
and the manager come and ask me ok what do you want??? Me.... medium meat
lover pizZa no sauce no crust in a pizza plate and she said ok. Sooo good

<h4>Rachael Adams</h4>

If anybody lives next to a sonic, and you can do eggs and cheese, their
ultimate meat and cheese burritos are super yummy! I just order two of
them in the same container with no tortilla and no potatoes. It's all
processed food, so it's not great for always… But every once in a
while if I'm in a rush in the morning, I will get this.

<h4>Michelle Howd</h4>

Sonic offers full menu all day! Burgers for breakfast.

If they can't find it, the patties are in the "Sides and Extras" menu.

shown: meat patty, sausage, bacon

<h4>Robyn Curtis</h4>

Went to Red Robin for dinner last night. Had the Royal Red Robin burger,
which is a half lb Angus patty with cheese and a fried egg on top. Ordered
without the bun or lettuce and tomato, and with a side of...another
1/2 lb patty. And no fries. The server looked at me weird but it was
delicious, and I was so full that I had no craving for popcorn when we
saw a movie after!

<h4>Jill Myint</h4>

Red Robin sells any meat patty as a side.

  INSIDERS INFO ON ORDERING FROM MCDONALD'S

</h3>

When they are priced too high, we will order plain McDoubles or
Cheeseburgers (tell them plain) and toss the bun. You will need 5 of
these for 1# of meat. These patties (called "reg meat") are slightly
smaller than the quarter pound pattie.

<h4>BREAKFAST STEAKS</h4>

They are kept in the UHC, or Universal Holding Cabinet. They come shipped to us strictly as steaks.
Onions are bagged separately and are the exact onions used for sandwiches, just have a liquid reduction sauce mixed in for grilling.

Ask them to cook you a fresh steak with no onions.

Ask for no seasoning as well... They do have a type of peppercorn seasoning, which is put on AFTER they are cooked.

Nothing is pre-mixed before. (Too many people with allergies)

So you can order everything plain.

<h4>EGGS</h4>

Ask for the round eggs. These are fresh eggs still in the shell, not the mix.

<h4>SAUSAGE</h4>

Sausage is non optimal, but far better than carb hashbrowns. If you like sausage and seem to do fine on it, order it!
My husband eats the sausage quite often.

Plus, normally, you can't get burgers before the change-over, although it can't hurt to ask. We've gotten burgers as early as 9 am

<h4>GRILLED CHICKEN</h4>

The grilled chicken no longer is seasoned with herbs, but with salt and pepper now.
Edited: Some marinade may be used.

But ALWAYS check first, as some stores are behind the times and may use herbs.

The chicken is cooked in real butter.

You can ask them to add cheese (American, Swiss or Cheddar) and bacon to ANY order. This will be rung up separately, and the crew member will tell the cook that you would like that added.

  McDonald’s A la Carte MENU CHOICES: By Marcy Lilly
  <a href="http://www.zerocarbhealth.com/index.php/2017/06/24/zero-carb-ordering-from-mcdonalds/" target="_blank">zerocarbhealth.com/index.php/2017/06/24</a>

McDonald’s burgers are 100% beef.  No fillers. (Don’t be foolish and believe all the stories out there)

The seasoning is 86% pepper, 14% salt.  There is NO msg, or anything else mixed in.

They are cooked on a special “plate” which has no oil or butter, and are cooked in their own juices

Order the 1/4 pound patties. If they have trouble, tell them it’s an add-on, on the a la carte menu. The manager may need to help. That’s ok…it’s a teaching moment, so the next time you go in, they will remember.

If you use this same store every time, eventually you can go through the Drive Thru because you have taught them that the Crazy Burger Person is ordering!

Each store sets their own price. We have gotten single patties for as low as $1 and as high as $2 each.

When they are priced too high, we will order plain McDoubles or Cheeseburgers (tell them plain) and toss the bun. You will need 5 of these for 1# of meat. These patties (called “reg meat”) are slightly smaller than the quarter pound pattie.

The following excerpts have been extracted from the comments Mr. Stanley
made on a Low Carbohydrate Forum in 2006. He followed a diet completely
free of all plant foods (with the exception of spices) for over 50
years…from 1958 (age 23) until his untimely death in a car accident in
2011 (age of 76). He has some crazy and some not so crazy ideas. I have
chosen only those comments pertaining to eating a Zero Carb diet. Most
of them have been copied and pasted onto this page without additional
editing due to time constraints.
