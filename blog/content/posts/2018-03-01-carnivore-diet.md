  McDonald’s A la Carte MENU CHOICES: By Marcy Lilly

McDonald’s burgers are 100% beef.  No fillers. (Don’t be foolish and believe all the stories out there)

The seasoning is 86% pepper, 14% salt.  There is NO msg, or anything else mixed in.

They are cooked on a special “plate” which has no oil or butter, and are cooked in their own juices

Order the 1/4 pound patties. If they have trouble, tell them it’s an add-on, on the a la carte menu. The manager may need to help. That’s ok…it’s a teaching moment, so the next time you go in, they will remember.

If you use this same store every time, eventually you can go through the Drive Thru because you have taught them that the Crazy Burger Person is ordering!

Each store sets their own price. We have gotten single patties for as low as $1 and as high as $2 each.

When they are priced too high, we will order plain McDoubles or Cheeseburgers (tell them plain) and toss the bun. You will need 5 of these for 1# of meat. These patties (called “reg meat”) are slightly smaller than the quarter pound pattie.

<h4>BREAKFAST STEAKS:</h4>

They are kept in the UHC, or Universal Holding Cabinet. They come shipped to us strictly as steaks.
Onions are bagged separately and are the exact onions used for sandwiches, just have a liquid reduction sauce mixed in for grilling.

Ask them to cook you a fresh steak with no onions.

Ask for no seasoning as well… They do have a type of peppercorn seasoning, which is put on AFTER they are cooked.

Nothing is pre-mixed before. (Too many people with allergies)

So you can order everything plain.

<h4>EGGS:</h4>

Ask for the round eggs. These are fresh eggs still in the shell, not the mix.

<h4>GRILLED CHICKEN:</h4>

The grilled chicken no longer is seasoned with herbs, but with salt and
pepper now.  Edited: Some marinade may be used.  But ALWAYS check first,
as some stores are behind the times and may use herbs.

The chicken is cooked in real butter.

You can ask them to add cheese (American, Swiss or Cheddar) and bacon
to ANY order. This will be rung up separately, and the crew member will
tell the cook that you would like that added.



<h4>ORDERING:</h4>

My husband orders 8-12 “1/4 pound meat patties only” (Another example:
“8 quarter pound meat patties…just the pattie”)

He always gives them the chance to hear him…many times they are so
trained to do it quickly they don’t hear everything you say.

Hearing “cheeseburger” they ring up cheeseburger immediately.
Tell them you want meat patties WITH cheese.

The following excerpts have been extracted from the comments Mr. Stanley
made on a Low Carbohydrate Forum in 2006. He followed a diet completely
free of all plant foods (with the exception of spices) for over 50
years…from 1958 (age 23) until his untimely death in a car accident in
2011 (age of 76). He has some crazy and some not so crazy ideas. I have
chosen only those comments pertaining to eating a Zero Carb diet. Most
of them have been copied and pasted onto this page without additional
editing due to time constraints.
