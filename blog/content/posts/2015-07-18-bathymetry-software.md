## MB-System

MB-System is an open source software package for the processing and
display of bathymetry and backscatter imagery data derived from multibeam,
interferometry, and sidescan sonars. The source code for MB-System is
freely available (for free) by anonymous ftp (including "point and click"
access through these web pages). A complete description is provided in
web pages accessed through links below.

MB-System was originally developed at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory
of Columbia University (L-DEO) and is now a collaborative effort between
the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) and L-DEO. The
National Science Foundation has provided the primary support for MB-System
development since 1993. The Packard Foundation has provided significant
support through MBARI since 1998. Additional support has derived from
SeaBeam Instruments (1994-1997), NOAA (2002-2004), and others.

## GDAL Python bindings

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/

One advanced feature of the GDAL Python bindings not found in the other
language bindings (C#, Perl) is integration with the Python numerical
array facilities. The gdal.Dataset.ReadAsArray() method can be used
to read raster data as numerical arrays, ready to use with the Python
numerical array capabilities.

## NumPy

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It
is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various
derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of
routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical,
shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms,
basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation
and much more.

Undersea Terrain Elevation (Bathymetry)

in general, unlike terrestrial elevation data, undersea data points tend
to not lie on regular grids, and tend to be much denser near landmasses

http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/5701/what-is-the-difference-between-dem-dsm-and-dtm



Recently, I came across with this discussion and I would like to register an answer too, more specifically about LiDAR.
It is common to see in Forestry LiDAR scientific articles acronyms DTM and DEM to be used as thesaurus.

According to Behrendt (2012), paragraph 6 on page 15, there is a difference between them:

    DTM: bare-earth representation with irregular spaces between points (non-raster).

    DEM: gridded raster representation of the DTM.

Still according to Beherendt (2012), paragraph 4, on page 15:

    DSM as a raster = "This represents the first echo the laser received for each laser pulse sent out, and represents the tops of buildings, trees, and other objects, or the ground, if unobstructed."
