The Final Roman Emperor, the Islamic Antichrist, and the Vatican's Last Crusade Paperback â€“ May 24, 2016
by Thomas Horn (Author), Cris Putnam (Author) 

Following the release of their first three international bestsellers
Petrus Romanus, Exo-Vaticana, and On the Path of the Immortals Thomas
Horn and Cris Putnam were swamped with interview requests from radio,
television, and print media outlets around the world. When they accurately
predicted the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI one full year in advance,
even naming the very month and year he would step down, global shockwaves
raised compelling questions regarding why the Vatican has an advanced
telescope perched atop Mt. Graham in Arizona (USA) where the Jesuits admit
they are monitoring something approaching Earth. Authors Horn and Putnam
visited the mountain and spoke with the astronomers. After their second
report was published in Exo-Vaticana, the pope s top astronomer took
to the airwaves (and on the Vatican Observatory website) in an attempt
to explain the role that he and other church astronomers are playing in
regard to the LUCIFER device on Mt. Graham, as well as their developing
doctrines concerning extraterrestrial life and the impact it may soon
have on planet Earth s religions (Christianity in particular). Then,
in the third book by Horn and Putnam, On the Path of the Immortals,
the authors set out with cameras and field investigators to unearth
their most astonishing discovery yet: Mt. Graham is a portal the
Native Americans who fought the Vatican and NASA told them a gateway to
another dimension. And, as the Vatican knows and the authors uncovered,
it is not the only one. Even then, they had no idea what secrets the
Vatican was shielding until now... FOR THEIR LAST ENTRY INTO THE 4-YEAR
INVESTIGATION, THE FINAL ROMAN EMPEROR, THE ISLAMIC ANTICHRIST, AND THE
VATICAN S LAST CRUSADE REVEALS... *Tom Horn s greatest prediction yet

of the Final Roman Emperor
