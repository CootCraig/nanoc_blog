  Handwriting Paper
</h4>

My research leads me to working with
three different sets of materials:

<b>American Cursive Handwriting by Michael Sull</b>:
a practical system of handwriting based on the Palmer Method.
This was recommended in the Art of Manliness article
<a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2014/12/16/improve-your-cursive-handwriting/" target="_blank">How and Why to Improve Your Cursive Penmanship</a>.
Two reasons for this one. Palmer script is nicer looking,
and this method book is highly recommended.

<b>Improve Your Handwriting: Teach Yourself</b>:
by Rosemary Sassoon, G. SE. Briem.
ISBN 10: 1444103792 ISBN 13: 9781444103793.
This is a guide to handwriting analysis
and developing an individual style.

<b>D'Nealian school books</b>:
The D'Nealian method has supplanted the Palmer method in schools.
The advantage is simplicity over Palmer
and more common letter forms between printed and cursive handwriting.
Since the 1960's schools that teach handwriting
have largely switched from Palmer to D'Nealian.

<h4>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmer_Method" target="_blank">wikipedia.org/wiki</a>
  Palmer Method
</h4>

The method developed around 1888 and was introduced in his book Palmer's
Guide to Business Writing (1894). Palmer's method involved "muscle
motion" in which the more proximal muscles of the arm were used for
movement, rather than allowing the fingers to move in writing. In spite
of opposition from the major publishers, this textbook enjoyed great
success: in 1912, 1 million copies were sold throughout the country.

Proponents of the Palmer Method emphasized its plainness and speed,
that it was much faster than the laborious Spencerian Method, and that
it allowed the writer to effectively compete with the typewriter.[4]
To educators, the method's advocates emphasized regimentation, and that
the method would thus be useful in schools to increase discipline and
character, and could even reform delinquents.[5]

The Palmer Method began to fall out of popularity in the 1950s and was
eventually supplanted by the Zaner-Bloser method, which sought to teach
children manuscript before teaching them cursive, in order to provide them
with a means of written expression as soon as possible, and thus develop
writing skills.[6] The D'Nealian method, introduced in 1978, sought to
address problems raised by the Zaner-Bloser method, returning to a more
cursive style. The Palmer company stopped publishing in the 1980s.[7]

  D'Nealian Manuscript
</h3>

Compare the ease of D'Nealian letters to traditional circle-and-stick. 

Try writing the word wake. First use the circle- and-stick letters. As you
trace the letters, note how often it's necessary to lift your pencil. The
more times a beginning writer has to lift a pencil, the harder it
becomes to make a legible letter. Now use the D'Nealian letters. Note
how few times you need to lift your pencil and how smoothly the D'Nealian
letters flow.

The D'Nealian manuscript alphabet cuts way down on common reversals
too. For example, how many students reverse the letters b and d or g
and p ? There's no problem with D'Nealian letters--because there are no
pencil lifts.

K5 Learning was founded by parents who wanted better learning tools
available to their kidsgirl-with-stack-of-books-cutout-.png.  We believe:

<ul>
  <li>Children's brains are like sponges. They can learn a lot given the opportunity.</li>
  <li>Kids can only reach their potential by learning at their own pace.</li>
  <li>Independent learning builds confidence and good study habits.</li>
  <li>One of the greatest gifts you can give your children is strong reading and math skills.</li>
</ul>

Many types of home study are best done with pencil and paper, away from
all screens and technology.  We launched our store to provide practical,
inexpensive and high quality workbooks for parents and students.
