##### King Salmon

King Salmon, also know as chinook, are the largest salmon species and one
of the most popular at the fish counter. In the wild they an grow to over
100 pounds and live for several years, making them prized amongst game
fisherman. Large, thick filets make for relatively easy cooking, though
they are not the most flavorful species. Farm-raised king salmon tend to
be smaller with a bit more intramuscular fat, giving them more richness.

##### Coho

Coho are far smaller than King Salmon with denser, brighter, more
flavorful flesh. With relatively little intramuscular fat and a very
fine texture, they're great for cured preparations such as gravlax.

##### Sockeye Salmon

Sockeye Salmon get their name from a Halkomelem word from the indigenous
people of British Columbia. Nothing to do with either socks or eyes. Known
for their deep red flesh and full flavor, they are quite small, which
makes them difficult to cook—thinner filets are prone to overcooking.

##### Arctic Char

Arctic Char are... not salmon. But they have a similar reddish-orange
flesh colored by the carotenoid pigments they get from feasting on
small shellfish. Their flavor and cooking qualities are quite similar
to Sockeye Salmon, though they tend to be a little fattier.

##### 110°F and below

At 110°F and below your salmon flesh is essentially raw. Translucent
and deep orange or red, it has the soft, fleshy texture of good sashimi.

##### 110 to 125°F

At 110 to 125°F your salmon is medium rare. The connective tissue
between layers of flesh has begun to weaken and if you insert a cake
tester or toothpick into the filet, it should slide in and out with no
resistence. The meat is relatively opaque, but still juicy and moist
without and chalkiness or fibrousness.

##### 125°F to 140°

At 125°F to 140° you are beginning to enter medium to well-done
territory. Flakiness will increase, and a chalky texture will start
to develop, though it won't be extreme. Albumen will start to get
expelled from the between the contracting muscle fibers and will begin to
coagulate in unattractive white clumps on the exterior of the salmon. In
the early stages of this clumping, your salmon is still rescuable (just
stop cooking it IMMEDIATELY).

##### 140°F and above

At 140°F and above, your salmon has reached its limit. From here on out,
it's just going to get chalkier, dryer, and more unattractive. This is
what salmon that sits in the steam table at the cafeteria looks like,
and probably why you didn't like eating salmon as a kid.
