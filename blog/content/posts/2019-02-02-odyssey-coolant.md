If it's approved for use in aluminum engines, you should be fine. I've
used Prestone Extended Life coolant forever. I'm jumping on the bandwagon
of people who do an annual drain/refill of the radiator to keep the
additives package fresh (i.e., the added compounds that support water
pump gland seal lubricity, pH maintenance, and keeping particulates
suspended in solution, etc.).

It's just so easy to do with that little drain plug that can be opened
and closed by hand at the bottom of the radiator.

Just emptying the radiator. Kind of like draining the ATF sump of 3.5
quarts, even though the whole transmission and lines hold a total of
8.3 quarts.

Don't have to burp it, at least I didn't have to the last four times I
did this (two Accords, two Odysseys), since the block retains its load
of coolant.

Cannot take credit for this...one of our other forum members does this
annually, and he posted it on one of the other threads.
