### Focus

AF is very fast on every camera. One full turn of the AF screw focuses
the lens from infinity to 6 feet (1.8m).

It will not autofocus on the D40 or D40x; turn the focus ring and look
for the electronic focus confirmation dot in the lower left of the finder.

### Recommendations

Just buy one if you think you want it. Everyone who does is amazed at
the quality.

I keep a 52mm Nikon NC filter and Nikon HR-2 rubber hood on it for
protection.

This lens makes no compromises in image quality. It is inexpensive
because it is a very simple lens to make. It uses a classic, proven
optical design. A $110 zoom lens has to cut many corners in image quality
that this 50mm doesn't.

None of the pros I know use exotic normal zooms. They all own these lenses
which they throw in a pocket for the few times they need a lens for low
light or to cover the range between their pro wide zoom and pro tele zoom.

If you intend to use this often in low light, then by all means spring
another $160 for the 50mm f/1.4 D. I shoot my 50mm f/1.4 with my D3 in
available light and I really like being able to shoot at f/1.4. For use
in daylight, this f/1.8 lens has less distortion and is just as sharp.

## Exposure Mode Selector Knob

### <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d40/users-guide/controls.htm" target="_blank">Top Panel Controls</a>

#### P: Program Automatic Exposure Mode

I use "P" for program auto exposure. In this mode the camera chooses
the f/stop and shutter speed for you.

It's easy to get to any aperture or shutter speed you prefer in
this mode: simply move the rear dial to shift them. This selects
alternate combinations of f/stops and shutter speeds which give the same
exposure. Nikon calls this "Program Shift." A *P symbol appears on the
bottom left of the viewfinder, to the left of the shutter speed.

Three easy ways to return to the standard program combination are to:

<ol>
  <li>flip to a different mode and back to P, or</li>
  <li>turn the D40 off and back on, or</li>
  <li>spin the rear dial back to its original position.</li>
</ol>

The *P symbol goes away when you've returned to the standard combinations.

The standard combinations are f/4 at 1/60, f/5.6 @ 1/125, f/8 @ 1/250,
f/11 @ 1/500, etc.

A shifted set might use f/4 @ 1/1,000, f/8 @ 1/500 or might use f/4 @
1/2, f/5.6 @ 1 sec, etc. Don't worry, just flick the rear dial until
you get the combination you prefer.

#### A, S and M Modes

If you want to use only one aperture or one shutter speed then use S or
A mode and the camera will automatically pick the other value. I never
use these; I shift the program instead.

If you want to set both the hard way, use M, manual, mode.

In A or S mode you can only set one of the two values because the camera
is setting the other one for you.

#### A Mode: Aperture Priority

In A mode you choose the Aperture and the D40 chooses the shutter speed.

#### S Mode: Shutter Priority

In S mode you set the Shutter and the D40 sets the aperture.

If the D40 runs out of available apertures you easily can get under or
over exposure in S mode: watch that the D40 can select a correct aperture
for your lighting.

#### M Mode: Manual Exposure

You have to set everything the hard way.

No one uses this mode except in complex conditions. Ignore old-timers
who tell you you need Manual mode; they say that because that's the only
mode cameras had back in the 1950s.

I look at the LCD to check exposure. You can use the bar graph in the
finder - but why? If you wanted to do that use another mode and let the
D40 do the setting for you.

The rear dial sets the shutter speed in manual exposure. To set the
aperture, hold the +/- (*) (diaphragm) button near the shutter and turn
the rear dial.

Firmware Defect: When turned ON, Auto ISO remains active in Manual mode. I
always turn off AUTO ISO when I enter Manual Mode, otherwise Auto ISO
changes the ISO and ruins whatever you were hoping to accomplish with
manual exposure mode.
