### Focus

AF is very fast on every camera. One full turn of the AF screw focuses
the lens from infinity to 6 feet (1.8m).

It will not autofocus on the D40 or D40x; turn the focus ring and look
for the electronic focus confirmation dot in the lower left of the finder.

### Recommendations

Just buy one if you think you want it. Everyone who does is amazed at
the quality.

I keep a 52mm Nikon NC filter and Nikon HR-2 rubber hood on it for
protection.

This lens makes no compromises in image quality. It is inexpensive
because it is a very simple lens to make. It uses a classic, proven
optical design. A $110 zoom lens has to cut many corners in image quality
that this 50mm doesn't.

None of the pros I know use exotic normal zooms. They all own these lenses
which they throw in a pocket for the few times they need a lens for low
light or to cover the range between their pro wide zoom and pro tele zoom.

If you intend to use this often in low light, then by all means spring
another $160 for the 50mm f/1.4 D. I shoot my 50mm f/1.4 with my D3 in
available light and I really like being able to shoot at f/1.4. For use
in daylight, this f/1.8 lens has less distortion and is just as sharp.

## Nikon 28mm f/2.8 AI-s

around $200 on ebay Sat Jul 30 17:45:47 MDT 2016

FX Manual-Focus (1981-today)  

No other Nikon 28mm lens performs this well: the 28mm f/1.4D AF has
some barrel distortion and really is optimized for night photography,
and every other 28mm lens just isn't designed as thoroughly.

This AI-s lens (1981-present) is completely different from the older AI
lens. Nikon made a big upgrade to the optics when they upgraded it to
AI-s, and they really pulled out all the stops.

Not only does this Nikkor uses 8 elements, it also uses floating elements
to optimize its performance as it is focused at every distance.

This is also Nikon's closest-focusing lens, with a close-focus distance
of 7 inches (0.6 ft), or 20 cm.

There is no sharper manual-focus wide angle lens made by Nikon, and it is
the only Nikon wide angle, along with the 15mm f/3.5, that is completely
free from barrel distortion at ordinary distances.

Optically this is an almost perfect lens, and one of the most perfect
lenses you can get to fit a Nikon camera.

The meters of cheaper digital (D90, D5000 and below) and cheaper film
cameras (N80 and below) will not couple (or work at all) with this lens,
so you'll be on your own guessing exposure using the rear LCD or an
external meter, or get a tiny Gossen Digisix meter and hot shoe adapter
to meter manually.

## Exposure Mode Selector Knob

### <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d40/users-guide/controls.htm" target="_blank">Top Panel Controls</a>

#### P: Program Automatic Exposure Mode

I use "P" for program auto exposure. In this mode the camera chooses
the f/stop and shutter speed for you.

It's easy to get to any aperture or shutter speed you prefer in
this mode: simply move the rear dial to shift them. This selects
alternate combinations of f/stops and shutter speeds which give the same
exposure. Nikon calls this "Program Shift." A *P symbol appears on the
bottom left of the viewfinder, to the left of the shutter speed.

Three easy ways to return to the standard program combination are to:

<ol>
  <li>flip to a different mode and back to P, or</li>
  <li>turn the D40 off and back on, or</li>
  <li>spin the rear dial back to its original position.</li>
</ol>

The *P symbol goes away when you've returned to the standard combinations.

The standard combinations are f/4 at 1/60, f/5.6 @ 1/125, f/8 @ 1/250,
f/11 @ 1/500, etc.

A shifted set might use f/4 @ 1/1,000, f/8 @ 1/500 or might use f/4 @
1/2, f/5.6 @ 1 sec, etc. Don't worry, just flick the rear dial until
you get the combination you prefer.

#### A, S and M Modes

If you want to use only one aperture or one shutter speed then use S or
A mode and the camera will automatically pick the other value. I never
use these; I shift the program instead.

If you want to set both the hard way, use M, manual, mode.

In A or S mode you can only set one of the two values because the camera
is setting the other one for you.

#### A Mode: Aperture Priority

In A mode you choose the Aperture and the D40 chooses the shutter speed.

#### S Mode: Shutter Priority

In S mode you set the Shutter and the D40 sets the aperture.

If the D40 runs out of available apertures you easily can get under or
over exposure in S mode: watch that the D40 can select a correct aperture
for your lighting.

#### M Mode: Manual Exposure

You have to set everything the hard way.

No one uses this mode except in complex conditions. Ignore old-timers
who tell you you need Manual mode; they say that because that's the only
mode cameras had back in the 1950s.

I look at the LCD to check exposure. You can use the bar graph in the
finder - but why? If you wanted to do that use another mode and let the
D40 do the setting for you.

The rear dial sets the shutter speed in manual exposure. To set the
aperture, hold the +/- (*) (diaphragm) button near the shutter and turn
the rear dial.

Firmware Defect: When turned ON, Auto ISO remains active in Manual mode. I
always turn off AUTO ISO when I enter Manual Mode, otherwise Auto ISO
changes the ISO and ruins whatever you were hoping to accomplish with
manual exposure mode.

# Gossen Digisix 

<a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/gossen/digisix/index.htm" target="_blank">kenrockwell.com article</a>

The Gossen Digisix is a tiny featherweight lightmeter. It can sit on
top of your camera, or vanish in a camera-bag side pocket or your pocket.

Everything is controlled with only two buttons.

It's always on. Once you tap the measure button, the reading stays there
until the battery runs down, and remains in memory even if you go look
at the temperature or the clock. It runs about 6 months to a year on
one common CR2032 cell.

# Rockwell guide

I reset everything every time I use my camera

## Exposure Compensation

I set my exposure compensation to -0.7 because my D40's metering firmware
is defective, just like the D80's meter. It usually overexposes.

Set -0.7 by holding the +/- button near the shutter and turning the rear
dial two clicks to the right.

just look at the image on the LCD and click it towards the left (+)
to lighten the image, and to the right (-) to darken it for the next shot.

## Shutter Advance Mode

I use Continuous (the bearded rectangle).

## ISO

I use ISO 200 and Auto ISO. 

I set Auto ISO to 1,600 max because the noise from the D40 at ISO 1,600
looks much better than blur.

Auto ISO increases the ISO automatically as it gets dark so I don't
have to. It shoots at ISO 200 in good light, and at 1/15 of a second
(or any speed you choose) it starts ramping up the ISO to a maximum of
1,600 (or any ISO you choose) as it gets darker. Only if it gets still
darker will it let the shutter speed go below 1/15 at ISO 1,600, exactly
as I'd do manually.

## OPTIMIZE IMAGE

I crave vivid color! I tweak my D40 to give color as vivid as I can
get. If it went to 11 I'd use that, too.

I go to MENU > Shooting Menu (green camera icon) > Optimize Image > Custom.

<b>Saturation:</b> +, of course. This gives brighter colors than the default.

## FOCUS (AF) Mode

I use the default of AF-A. This mode automatically selects between the
two older modes, AF-C and AF-S.

Each time you double the ISO (for example, from 200 to 400), the
camera needs only half as much light for the same exposure. So if
you had a shutter speed of 1/250 at 200 ISO, going to 400 ISO would
let you get the same exposure at 1/500 second (providing the aperture
remains unchanged). This is why high ISOs are so often used indoors,
especially at sporting events. Needing a fast shutter speed to stop
action, photographers regularly choose ISO 1600 or above.

In digital cameras, raising the ISO means a similar decrease in quality,
with an increase in what's called "noise." It's the digital equivalent
of grain and results in a sort of "chunky" look to the image. Very
early digital cameras had objectionable levels of noise at ISOs as low
as 800. Today most digital SLRs can make good quality images at ISOs up
to 1600 and above. However, several variables affect this.

#### Shutter speed:

Speeds faster than one second are shown as fractions (e.g.: …1/125,
1/160, 1/200, 1/250…). Some cameras may omit the numerator so that
“1/125” becomes “125,” “1/250” becomes “250,” etc. Speeds
slower than one second are shown by a double prime symbol following the
value (e.g.: 1 ˝).

Beginners D40 guide to long exposure photography. 

### Ken Rockwell says

AE-L AF-L / Key Button (Top Right Center)

This can lock the focus and/or exposure or turn on the autofocus.

You set what it locks in Custom Setting 12. I set mine to lock exposure
for as long as I hold the button (AE lock only).

Look in your manual for Shutter Speed "BULB", this allows you to open
the shutter with one click and close it with the next, also to get crisp
pictures you will need to keep the camera steady, its a blast for night
shoots etc. Have a blast learning you new camera.......

Remote control in manual mode*. It is by far the best way to do it,
and one of the best accesories you can get for your camera for very
little money:


the "bulb" setting only keeps the shutter open foras long the release
button is held down, which is of little use as the D40 doesn't support
a cable release; when set to remote control, you have access to the "--"
setting instead (my guess is it is supposed to mean "indefinite"). This
allows you to open the shutter with one press of the remote and close
it with another, as Jeepin59 said.
