  Micro-clover: a New Groundcover to Discover
</h3>

There are several micro-clover cultivars, but ‘Pipolina’ seems to be
the only one that is available in North America. It is rarely available
in local garden centers. You pretty much have to have it delivered. Here
are a few suppliers that will ship seed to you:

<h4>Magazine</h4>

Maine journalist and landscaper Paul Tukey[1] co-founded People, Places
& Plants in late 1995[3] and the magazine's first issue was published
in January 1996. At the initial phase, the magazine was headquartered
in Falmouth, Maine.[4] By late 1997, the magazine was the top-selling
garden magazine in Maine.[5]

After establishing itself as a publication on gardening in New England
and New York, a Mid-Atlantic edition was launched in 2003.[6] It suffered
from sluggish sales and was discontinued in late 2004. People, Places &
Plants published its 50th issue, billed also as a special 10th anniversary
issue, in May 2005.[7]

During late 2008 and 2009 issues of PPP were sporadic. The spring 2009
issue (volume 14, issue 2, edition 70) was received in June 2009 and
on the bottom of page 12, it was announced that the magazine frequency
was decreasing from six issues per year to three. The spring 2009 issue
was the last one mailed to subscribers. Subscribers continue to wonder
whether they will ever receive another issue or a refund.

In a gardening column by Tom Atwell in the Sunday Press Herald on
January 31, 2010, Rick Churchill (one of the writers of the magazine)
announced: PPP has ceased publication, although Paul Tukey has made no
official announcement. There has not been an issue for eight months,
and issues were sporadic before that. Tukey, contacted by e-mail, said
the magazine is not yet officially dead. "It is still listed for sale
by a Portland broker," he wrote, "and several entities are interested
in acquiring the title to move it forward in some fashion. Until that
happens, we've been holding off making an announcement." He hopes to
notify subscribers by March 1, 2010.

However, as of June 14, 2010, subscribers have not been notified by the
editor and the PPP website is offline. The magazine officially ceased
publication and the offices have long since closed.  Television program

A television program of People, Places & Plants, filmed at Weston
Nurseries in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, and hosted by Roger Swain and Paul
Tukey, debuted in March 2003.[8] Two seasons were produced and aired
on Home & Garden Television.[9] Tukey earned the honor of America's
Horticultural Communicator of the Year from the American Horticultural
Society in 2006.

<h1>Roger Swain - Victory Garden</h1>

Roger Swain, known as "the man with the red suspenders", is most famous
for hosting the television show, The Victory Garden on PBS. He was the
host from the mid-1980s until 2001.

He graduated from Harvard College and went on to earn a Ph.D. from
Harvard University in Biology. From 1978 to 2008 he was writer and
science editor at Horticulture Magazine. He is the author of five books:
Earthly Pleasures, Field Days, The Practical Gardener, Saving Graces,
and Groundwork. From 2005-06 he was the co-host of the television show
People, Places, and Plants with Paul Tukey on HGTV. Roger was married
for 31 years to Elisabeth Ward Swain, who died in February 2008.

Roger Swain made no bones about it.

"I better hurry up and find a replacement for myself," the retired host of
"The Victory Garden" on PBS told the crowd of more than 140 people.

Having gardened for 60 years, written about horticulture for 30 years and
hosted more than 500 episodes of one of the most popular gardening shows,
the grow-your-own advocate knows his shoes will be difficult to fill.

So, he enlists everyone he can to get out there and plant something,
whether in a container or in the yard.

<h1>Clover in Lawn</h1>

  The Clover Option
</h2>

<h4>The Clover Option</h4>

Before herbicides came into common use in the 1950s, white clover
(Trifolium repens) was a common, natural and desired component of
temperate region turfs. It was eliminated from many lawns by the regular
use of herbicide.

When white clover reinvades lawns naturally, it develops in patches
which can look unsightly. If the lawn is managed to encourage clover,
it will eventually be distributed throughout the lawn, forming a thick
turf and a pleasing mosaic of leaf textures. To accelerate this process,
or to establish clover if it is not present, Dutch white clover can be
overseeded into a turf or included with the initial seedmix for turf.

<h4>There are many benefits to a grass/clover lawn</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Clover and other legumes are infected by soil bacteria which form nitrogen-fixing nodules on the roots. Nitrogen fixation is the process by which free nitrogen gas in air (N2), which plants cannot use, is converted into a form they can use. In HRM lawns, this process can contribute the equivalent of 2 lbs of nitrogen per 1000 square feet annually (1 kg N/100m2 ).[L25] Combined with mulch-mowing this is enough to supply most of the turf's needs for nitrogen.</li>
  <li>Weeds "disappear" in a clover lawn. See examples</li>
  <li>Providing nitrogen inputs via legumes and recycling of residues (grass clippings) reduces leaching of all nutrients; requirements for lime may be reduced by 75% or more.[V40, V41]</li>
  <li>Grass/clover turfs maintain greenness through mid-summer droughty periods when straight bluegrass turfs go into dormancy unless well watered.[L6, L25].</li>
  <li>Clover competes effectively with other broadleaf plants, reducing the amount of manual-weeding required.[L6]</li>
  <li>An appropriately managed grass/clover turf forms an aesthetically pleasing sward which masks the presence of many types of weeds, i.e., the weeds blend into the sward, rather than stand out.</li>
  <li>A mixed grass/clover sward tends to be more resistant to pests and diseases, and is less wasteful of nutrients than is a straight grass sward.[L6]</li>
  <li>A mixed grass/clover/small-leafed-flowering-dicot sward supports pollinators!</li>
  <li>Clover is reported not to scald, as grass does, when dogs urinate on it. [L31]</li>
  <li>Last but certainly not least: a clover lawn increases biodiversity, especially by supporting pollinating insects. </li>
</ul>

  Clover Comeback - How to Grow a Clover Lawn by George and Becky Lohmiller
</h3>

At one time, most lawns had at least some clover growing in them, with
many consisting almost entirely of clover plants. Today, many lawn
enthusiasts are trying to limit the use of pesticides and are again
turning to clover.

<h4>Benefits of Clover</h4>

<ul>
  <li>White clover (Trifolium repens) is a rapid spreader that crowds out broadleaf weeds while growing harmoniously with grass. It will thrive in areas that are poorly drained or too shady for a conventional lawn.</li>
  <li>Like white clover, red clover (Trifolium pratense) is native to Europe, but has been naturalized in North America. It typically grows taller than white clover and produces attractive purple flowers.</li>
  <li>Being a legume, the clover plant has the ability to convert nitrogen into fertilizer using bacteria in it’s root system, practically eliminating the need for additional fertilization.</li>
  <li>Clover is an extremely drought-resistant plant and will keep its cool-green color even during the hottest and driest parts of summer.</li>
  <li>Left uncut, white clover grows 4-8 inches tall and produces small white flowers that are often tinged with pink. The flowers not only create a beautiful visual effect, but also bring in bees, butterflies, and beneficial insects that prey on garden pests.</li>
  <li>Honeybees rarely sting when they are away from their hive, but if they make you uncomfortable or you are allergic to bee stings, simply have the lawn mowed more often when clover is in bloom.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Planting Clover</h4>

You can plant clover by itself for ground cover, but it stands up better
to foot traffic when combined with lawn grass.

<ul>
  <li>Only 5-10% by weight of tiny clover seed needs to be mixed with the recommended amount of grass seed to create a thick stand.</li>
  <li>When adding clover to an existing lawn, first mow it close and remove any thatch to allow the seed to fall to the soil surface.</li>
  <li>To sow clover alone, mix it with enough sand to facilitate spreading. About 2 ounces of clover is needed for every 1,000 square feet of lawn.</li>
</ul>

  Beneficial Clover in Lawns -
  Paul James shares his top three reasons for loving clover.
</h3>

Master gardener Paul James takes a lot of flack for his stance on
weeds, specifically his recommendation that lawns should contain a small
percentage of weeds. This recommendation is based on the belief that weeds
promote biodiversity and thereby reduce pest and disease problems. Weeds
also provide food and nesting sites for beneficial insects, and tolerating
weeds will help make chemical herbicides obsolete.

From a distance, Paul's lawn looks pretty nice. The population of
weeds is in the neighborhood of 15 percent and includes a number of
interesting plants. One of his favorite weeds is white Dutch clover
(Trifolium repens), which he has loved since he was a kid. "I remember
spending hours on end looking for a lucky four-leaf clover, although I
don't recall ever finding one," says Paul.
