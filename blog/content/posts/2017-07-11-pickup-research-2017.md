The GMT 400 and similar GMT 480 is the platform for the 1988-1998
full-size pickup truck. The GMT 410, GMT 420, GMT 425, and GMT 430
were used for full-size SUVs from 1991 to 2000. This was the first GMT
designation for the C (RWD) and K (4WD/AWD) full-size trucks and SUVs.

  Engines - Fourth generation 1988–1998 (GMT400)
</h2>

Development of these trucks began around 1984 and were introduced in
April 1987 as 1988 models (known as the GMT400 platform, and also known
by the nickname OBS (Old Body Style) Chevy or GMC), there were eight
different versions of the C/K line for 1988: Fleetside Single Cab,
Fleetside Extended Cab, Fleetside Crew Cab, and Stepside Single Cab,
each in either 2WD (C) or 4WD (K) drivelines. All C/K models would ride on
independent front suspension. Three trim levels were available: Cheyenne,
Scottsdale, and Silverado. Engines were a 160 hp (119 kW) 4.3 L V6, a 175
hp (130 kW) 5.0 L V8, a 210 hp (157 kW) 5.7 L V8 and a 6.2 L diesel V8. A
230 hp (172 kW) 7.4 L V8 was available in the 3/4-ton and one-ton trucks.

A drastic difference between the third-generation and fourth-generation
GM trucks was the suspension; the fourth-generation GM trucks used all
independent front suspensions (IFS).

The L05 was introduced in 1987 for use in Chevrolet/GMC trucks in the
GMT400 (introduced in April 1987 as 1988 models) and the R/V series trucks
such as the K5 Blazer, Suburban, and rounded-era pickups formerly classed
as the C/K until 1991 which includes chassis cabs and 4-door crew cabs.

The Vortec 5700 L31 (Vin code 8th digit "R") is a V8 truck
engine. Displacement is 5.7 L. It is the last production Generation
I small-block from Chevrolet. The cylinder heads feature combustion
chambers and intake ports very similar to those of the LT1 V8, but
without the reverse-flow cooling. As such, the L31 head is compatible
with all older small-blocks, and is a very popular upgrade. It offers
the performance of more expensive heads, at a much lower cost. It does,
however, require a specific intake manifold (A 5.7L, 350 CI L31, Vortec
engine has eight bolts attaching the intake manifold or four per head,
as opposed to the traditional six bolts per head twelve in total found on
older Chevrolet small blocks). The L31 was replaced by the 5.3 L 5300 LM7.

The Vortec 5700 L31 (Vin code 8th digit "R") is a V8 truck
engine. Displacement is 5.7 L.

L31 applications: 1996–1999 Chevrolet/GMC C/K full-size trucks
