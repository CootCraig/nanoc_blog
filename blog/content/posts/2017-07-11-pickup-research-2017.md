Engine sizes were converted to metric for 1983, causing the 300 to become
the "4.9". Fuel injection and other changes in 1987 pushed output up to
150 horsepower with 8.8:1 compression. This engine was gradually phased
out, ending production in 1996, and was replaced by the Essex V6 in the
F-series trucks with their 1997 redesign. However, it was renowned for
its durability, low end torque, and ease of service. The 300 4.9 came
with the Ford C6, E4OD, AOD, ZF S5-42 and S5-47 transmissions, as well
as the Mazda built M5OD 5-speed manual transmission, and the Borg-Warner
T18, Tremec RTS, and New Process NP435 4-speed manual transmissions. The
4.9-liter 6-cylinder was built in the Cleveland, Ohio engine plant. Race
car driver Scott Donohue Raced a rally truck with a ford 4.9 in it and
won the baja 1000 3 times

  Ford 300 cid (4.9L) I-6 - 300 cid, 4.9L Straight 6 Engine Specs
</h3>

Ford's 300 cid "Big Six" was introduced to the F-Series platform for the
1965 model year. Its architecture is based on the smaller 240 cid I-6,
with the 300's cylinder stroke being longer while sharing the identical
cylinder bore. The 300 and later 4.9L straight 6 (Ford converted to a
metric measurement convention in 1983) earned an incredible reputation
for its strength, reliability, and low end torque during the course of
its 31 years of service. The rugged, venerable 300 straight 6 featured
unmatched longevity, and its relatively broad torque curve provided
flexibility in a range of driving conditions. The engine was not limited
to F-Series pickup applications; it can be found in a variety of vehicles
and equipment, including agricultural/construction machinery, tractors,
medium duty dump/utility trucks, generators, and delivery trucks. It
was retired following the 1996 model year, ultimately being replaced by
Ford's smaller 4.2L V-6.

<h3>1995–97 7.3 L Direct injection Turbo, Powerstroke, International T444E</h3>

Despite sharing identical displacement with its IDI predecessor, the
turbocharged Powerstroke/T444E was an all-new design with direct fuel
injection. This is akin to the 5.0l/302c.i. v8 used in foxbody platform
Mustangs, for example, is not the same as the 5.0l/302c.i. Coyote v8
used in current mustangs. The only similarity between the two motors is
the displacement.

F-150: 1/2 ton (6,250 lb GVWR max)

The ninth generation Ford F-Series is a line of full-size and medium-duty
commercial trucks that were produced by Ford from 1991 to 1996. While
still based on the basic design dating from late 1979 (for the 1980
model year), the 1992 F-Series brought a number of minor changes to the
exterior and interior (where most enthusiasts consider this a facelift
for the same existing truck that first appeared in 1979 as a 1980 model
instead of a redesign). This is the last generation of the F-Series that
was produced as a complete range of trucks from a half-ton pickup (F-150)
to a medium-duty Class 6 truck (F-250 and above). As this generation
was replaced during the 1997–1998 model years, the larger models of
the F-Series (F-250 and above) were split from the F-150; these became
the Ford Super Duty trucks, related to the latter with a few powertrain
components.

The GMT 400 and similar GMT 480 is the platform for the 1988-1998
full-size pickup truck. The GMT 410, GMT 420, GMT 425, and GMT 430
were used for full-size SUVs from 1991 to 2000. This was the first GMT
designation for the C (RWD) and K (4WD/AWD) full-size trucks and SUVs.

  Engines - Fourth generation 1988–1998 (GMT400)
</h2>

Development of these trucks began around 1984 and were introduced in
April 1987 as 1988 models (known as the GMT400 platform, and also known
by the nickname OBS (Old Body Style) Chevy or GMC), there were eight
different versions of the C/K line for 1988: Fleetside Single Cab,
Fleetside Extended Cab, Fleetside Crew Cab, and Stepside Single Cab,
each in either 2WD (C) or 4WD (K) drivelines. All C/K models would ride on
independent front suspension. Three trim levels were available: Cheyenne,
Scottsdale, and Silverado. Engines were a 160 hp (119 kW) 4.3 L V6, a 175
hp (130 kW) 5.0 L V8, a 210 hp (157 kW) 5.7 L V8 and a 6.2 L diesel V8. A
230 hp (172 kW) 7.4 L V8 was available in the 3/4-ton and one-ton trucks.

A drastic difference between the third-generation and fourth-generation
GM trucks was the suspension; the fourth-generation GM trucks used all
independent front suspensions (IFS).

The L05 was introduced in 1987 for use in Chevrolet/GMC trucks in the
GMT400 (introduced in April 1987 as 1988 models) and the R/V series trucks
such as the K5 Blazer, Suburban, and rounded-era pickups formerly classed
as the C/K until 1991 which includes chassis cabs and 4-door crew cabs.

The Vortec 5700 L31 (Vin code 8th digit "R") is a V8 truck
engine. Displacement is 5.7 L. It is the last production Generation
I small-block from Chevrolet. The cylinder heads feature combustion
chambers and intake ports very similar to those of the LT1 V8, but
without the reverse-flow cooling. As such, the L31 head is compatible
with all older small-blocks, and is a very popular upgrade. It offers
the performance of more expensive heads, at a much lower cost. It does,
however, require a specific intake manifold (A 5.7L, 350 CI L31, Vortec
engine has eight bolts attaching the intake manifold or four per head,
as opposed to the traditional six bolts per head twelve in total found on
older Chevrolet small blocks). The L31 was replaced by the 5.3 L 5300 LM7.

The Vortec 5700 L31 (Vin code 8th digit "R") is a V8 truck
engine. Displacement is 5.7 L.

L31 applications: 1996–1999 Chevrolet/GMC C/K full-size trucks
