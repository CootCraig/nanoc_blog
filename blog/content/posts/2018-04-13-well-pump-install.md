subject:
Request for comments on well pump and tank selections.

Information on the well:
Yield of 7-8 gpm. I measured over a 1 hour flow test.
7" casing
depth of well: 40 ft.
depth of pump: 36ft.

current pump is:
Myers Pentair Water "The Rustler"
Model #: 3NFL102-20-P4-01
1 HP. 20gpm. 3 Wire. 230V. single phase.

The well is used to irrigate the property and supply 4 yard faucets.

With pressure from irrigating the spray is strong at first, but drops off after a few minutes to not enough flow/psi for the sprinklers.  I have a sonic water depth tester and there is water in the casing when the sprinklers stop.

I plan to install a Cycle Stop Valves PK1A Kit
https://cyclestopvalves.com/pages/pk1a-pside-kick-specifications

with a CSV1A pressure setting of 50psi and a dole valve to limit flow.

The performance log of the Grundfos 10S05-9 Pump looks to be a good match for my use.

Who Makes the Best Submersible Pump?
https://terrylove.com/forums/index.php?threads/who-makes-the-best-submersible-pump.64632/
I am considering this pump from envisupply.com. Their well expert says he has sold combinations like this before.  I may not have the part particulars right.

Franklin 2145059004GS Motor
Franklin 2801054915 Control Box
Grundfos 10S05-9 Pump End 9010009

As an alternative, what about using the Grundfos 10S05-9 Pump End with the current 1 HP myers pump?

Three-wire motors through 1 hp use Franklin's exclusive three-wire QD
(Quick Disconnect) Control Box with the patented QD Relay. This relay
provides the ultimate in operational life.

Single-phase motors can be used with Pumptec products to protect against
dry-run and other installation conditions that can damage motors and/or
pumps. See Single-phase Protection Devices for details.

Franklin single-phase controls are designed and optimized specifically for
Franklin Electric motors. Controls are an integral part of a submersible
motor power system. Rigorous component testing ensures the most robust
products in the industry.

These highly engineered control boxes are designed for use with Franklin
3-wire, single-phase submersible motors 1/3 to 1 hp. Quick Disconnect (QD)
boxes make trouble shooting simple by automatically disconnecting the
control components from the system when the lid is removed. Solid state
switching, with the QD Relay, provides longer life than voltage relays,
and improves the operation of the system. QD and Capacitor Run Control
(CRC) boxes offer the same functionality, but CRC boxes feature a run
capacitor for smoother motor operation.

Today we are comparing different types of drop pipe that we offer. We will
be discussing the pro’s and cons of using PVC drop pipe, Galvanized
drop pipe and using high-pressure poly pipe as drop pipe. It may be
surprising to know there are multiple factors to consider when selecting
the best type and size of drop pipe for your well application. The main
points to consider are:

<pre>
Weight limitations (or depth limitations) 
Flow Restriction
WaterComposition
Ease of Installation & Removal
</pre>

2 min. - high density poly
less than 100'

  Torque Arrestor for Submersible Well Pumps 
  <a href="http://store.waterpumpsupply.com/torarforsubw.html" target="_blank">waterpumpsupply.com/torarfor</a>
</h3>

<h4>Where is the torque arrester installed?</h4>

The torque arrestor is installed right above the pump and clamps over the wires.

<h4>How snug should the torque arrester be?</h4>

Set it so that there is just enough clearance to allow it to easily go
down the well casing. While is helps center the pump, it's main function
is to adsorb motor starting torque.

<h4>Should I use a safety rope or cable to lower the pump and motor?</h4>

Yes……the safety rope should be large enough to support the weight of
the pump, piping, wire, etc., and is left on the pump and tied off at the
top of the well. Obviously, if galvanized pipe is used versus poly pipe,
the rope needs to be able to hold the extra weight.

  Who Makes the Best Submersible Pump?

</h3>

While we have never had a problem using the “floating impeller”
design pump made by Pentair, we are having problems with the NEW Franklin
design. It apparently has a flawed design that causes excess heat from
the dragging impellers when using less than 3 GPM or so. Now they are
recommending against using Dole Valves, CSV’s, gate valves, or any
other type of restrictor.

I also do not think these new Franklin pumps will survive long when used
with a flow switch, as controls the pump with their new Inline 400 series
boosters. These flow switches will keep the pump running if you are using
flows as low as 1/5th of a GPM and the impellers will melt down quickly.

Since we now know that less than 3 GPM will cause “Poor performance and pump shavings and debris after a year to 18 months of use”, these inline boosters will probably not last very long. I have never known a pump manufacturer to make changes to their pumps or motors to increase the life of the pump/motor. They only make changes to decrease the dependability of their pump/motors, as it is more profitable for them if your pump doesn’t last very long.

I have always been a fan of Franklin motors. But after reading about their
“new” design I no longer recommend Franklin pumps to be used with
Cycle Stop Valves. Pump manufacturers have long disliked the fact that
CSV’s make pumps last longer and use smaller pressure tanks. So now they
have redesigned their pump so it purposely will not work with a CSV. But
that also means it will not work with a Dole Valve, gate valve, or any
other restrictive device. These pumps will also not last very long when
being controlled by a flow switch, as in the In-Line 400 booster pumps.

I will no longer recommend Franklin pumps and suggest switching to a
different brand that does not have “floating”, which really means
“dragging” impellers. Grundfos and Goulds have always been a good
pump and still have impellers fixed to the pump shaft. There are many
other brands of pumps with this type of design. Pumps that have impellers
fixed to the shaft are totally frictionless. They will draw less energy,
produce less heat, work at lower flow rates, and last longer than any
pump with a “floating impeller” design.

Grundfos sure messed up when they switched from 4 straps to 3. We had
very few problems with the 4 straps. But with a high pressure pump like
a 1HP-5 I can see where those straps might not hold and let the check
valve squirt water sideways. I was always very careful to tighten those
straps as much as possible because I had seen that problem before. There
are lots of copies of the Grundfos out now. Pretty much anyone who has a
Stainless Steel impeller pump is a copy of a Grundfos. It is the Grundfos
motor I am more worried about.

My favorite is still a Grundfos pump on a Franklin motor. At least until
they change them again and mess things up even further.

I would think the 5-7 GPM deep set pumps would last much better if they
were not the "floating impeller" type. The Grundfos or any of the pumps
that have impellers held up by the motor thrust bearing are going to
produce much less heat. And with only 5-7 GPM flow, I would think that
to be important.

I have always used 3 wire motors with control boxes. I haven't noticed
them to have high starting current. It is probably the design of the
2 wire motor that causes the high start amps. The start cap in the 3
wire units may also help with the stuck ceramic bearing or the "floating
impellers" sticking to the diffusers. We always used the 3 wire because
it has more starting torque if you have a little sand in the pump. But
it could help in your case if these other flaws in the pumps are just
keeping it from getting started.

<h4>craigpump</h4>

We stock 2 wire pumps because there are so many older three wire installs
with direct buried wire and in order to be code compliant, the system
has to be grounded back to the panel. we do have 3 wire motors on the
truck that we can quickly swap out for 3 wire w/ ground installations.

My father used to get Aermotors direct back in the 70's, lots of profit
but poor factory support when it came to warranties. He got a couple of
pallets of pumps that had excess flashing on the stages, seems every one
that went in had to come right out, be taken apart and have the flashing
trimmed off...

I have always said there is very little difference between any of the different brands of submersible pumps. However, after many recent changes in designs there are some brands that are no longer as good as some other brands. My favorite has always been the Grundfos Stainless Steel pumps. The "floating stack" design and the Stainless Steel construction of the Grundfos is much preferred over the "floating impeller" design with plastic impellers being produced now by many other manufacturers.

A recent "pumps" issue of the Water Well Journal has several adds from other companies who now make a Stainless Steel pump similar to or a copy of the Grundfos pump. Just a few manufacturers names in the adds are Shakti, National, Unitra, SEI, C.R.I., and Hydroflo. I am sure there are other all Stainless Steel pumps manufacturers, and I will add those names as I find them. These Stainless Steel "floating stack" designs are preferable especially if you are using restrictive devices like Dole Valves and Cycle Stop Valves, as they will safely handle much lower flow rates and have a better reduction in amp draw at low flow than pumps with "floating impeller" designs.

<h3>
  DETERMINING TOTAL DYNAMIC HEAD
  <a href="http://www.raincollectionsupplies.com/v/vspfiles/assets/images/tdh%20explanation.pdf" target="_blank">raincollectionsupplies.com/v/</a>
</h3>

The  total  dynamic  head  of  a  water  system  must  be  considered
when  determining  the  size  of pumping  equipment  to  be  installed.
It  determines  the  various  head  losses  that  the  pump  must
overcome.  Total dynamic head = elevation head + friction head loss +
pressure head.

A)  Elevation head 

is  the  vertical  distance  which  the  water  must  be  pumped.
It  is the elevation difference in feet between the pumping level in
the well and the pressure tank.

B) Friction  head  loss

is  the  loss of  pressure  due  to  the  flow  of  water  through
pipe  and  fittings.  Determine  diameter,  length,  and  type  of
pipe  material through which the water flows from the well  to  the
pressure  tank.    Using  the  pump  flow  rate  as  determined  from
the  Residential  Unit Method  or  Fixture  Method,  refer  to  Table
I  (Friction  Loss  Charts)  and  Table  2 (Resistance of Valves  and
Fittings  to  Flow  of  Fluids) to determine friction head loss due to
pipe and fittings.  Friction loss can be overcome by using a larger pipe
size or changing piping materials. (Note: In small water systems with
few fittings, the head loss due to the fittings may he disregarded.)

C) Pressure  head  

 is  the  maximum  operating  pressure  of  the  water  system  converted  from  
pressure  (psi)  to  feet  of  head.    If  the  pres
sure  switch  setting  is  30

50 psi, then the maximum pressure is 50 psi.  Convert psi to feet of head
using the following conversion: 1 psi = 2.31 feet of head.  Therefore,
pressure head equals maximum operating pressure x 2.31 feet

D.  Other head losses to be considered:

<pre>
Water softener ............................  10 psi x 2.31 = head in feet
Iron filter ....................................  20 psi x 2.31 = head in feet
Hot water heater ..........................  2 psi x 2.31 = head in feet
</pre>

<pre>
40 psi * 2.31 feet/psi
40 * 2.31 => 92.4 feet dynamic head

50 psi * 2.31 feet/psi
50 * 2.31 => 115.5
115.5 + 25 => 140.5

60 psi * 2.31 feet/psi
60 * 2.31 => 138.6
138.6 + 25 => 163.6
