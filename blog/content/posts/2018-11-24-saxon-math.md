  Recognizing an American Hero: John Saxon July 24, 2014 By Nakonia (Niki) Hayes 
</h3>

Saxon scoffed when reformists insisted that historically-proven
mathematics, which had been developed over 2,000 years by diverse cultures
from around the world, was effective only with “white males” in
America—and “Asians.” Then, he would explode with anger over what
he called disastrous teaching materials and methods being purchased
without proof of their results.

The biggest surprise to the leaders was when Saxon bought full-page
advertisements in mathematics journals, magazines and major newspapers
to respond to the charges laid against him and his work. As a World War
II veteran, West Point graduate, Korean War combat pilot awarded the
Distinguished Flying Cross, and a Vietnam veteran, Saxon was a fully
trained and experienced warrior who was now fighting “a good war”
for children in American mathematics education. Later described as the
“George Patton of math education,” Saxon saw no purpose in losing
any battle and was not averse to launching a frontal assault. He often
got bloodied, but so did they.
