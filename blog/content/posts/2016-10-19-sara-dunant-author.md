The dark, wild tale of Radegunda, a captured queen who becomes the
founding abbess of a convent in the dark ages, helped Sarah Dunant while
she was researching her own novel about nuns in 16th-century Italy

I first read Julia O'Faolain's vibrant and strange Women in the Wall
two years ago, just before I started writing my own novel about nuns in
a 16th-century Italian convent. I had come out of a year incarcerated in
libraries and archives in Britain and Italy, and my head was reeling with
wondrous and terrifying images and ideas. Most writers will relate to that
feeling of panic as you put away the notebooks and move to the keyboard,
and I thought O'Faolain's journey into a darker, wilder moment of history
- the political and religious chaos of sixth-century Gaul, and the life
of Radegunda, who began as captured queen to King Clotair and ended as
the founding abbess of a convent in Poitiers, and a Meravingian saint -
might just help.
