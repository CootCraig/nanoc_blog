Ultrasonic transducers are generally rated by their input power
requirements. In the frequency ranges we're talking about, most of the
transducers are 60 watts each. They actually output something less than
that into the cleaning solution of course. The rules of thumb for the
small tank sizes we're using is that you want total transducer power of 80
to 120 watts per gallon. The Sonix IV ST-136 has three 60-watt transducers
for a total of 180 watts into 1.5 gallons. So that's at the upper end
of the power range needed (180watts /1.5 gal. = 120 watts/gallon).

Assuming the total transducer power is appropriate for the tank size,
the other rule of thumb is you can clean just under approx. 2 sq inches of
surface area per watt of input power at any point in time. So that's about
350 sq. inches of surface area in the tank, max., or 3 albums (6 album
sides) with about â…“ of each album immersed at any given instant. That
just happens to work out to be about 1 album per 60watt transducer.

Be careful when looking at power stats for UCs. They often quote "Peak
Power" which is startup power draw, and that usually includes the heater
wattage too! What's relevant for the cleaning capability is just the
ave. transducer power only, not at peak, and not including the heater.
