  Poulan Pro PP5020AV Gas Chainsaw | Review
</h3>

The Poulan Pro PP5020AV is an exceptional gas chainsaw for under
$200. Poulan Pro is owned by Husqvarna, which means many of the
components on the Poulan Pro PP5020AV are taken straight from other
Husqvarna chainsaws

When buying the Poulan Pro PP5020AV you essentially get the equivalent
Husqvarna quality, comparable to the Husqvarna 440E gas chainsaw — for
a lot less money. I know, it’s not exactly the same, but the overall
reliability and build quality is similar. In some ways it’s better,
because you get a lot for very little money. It’s inexpensive —
not cheap.


Get the: OREGON 72LGX072G – 72 Drive Link Super Guard Chain.

  PowerCut™ Saw Chain, 20" Part #72LGX072G
</h4>

Top performing 3/8" pitch chain, ideal for high-production cutting. Oregon
72LGX low-vibration, full chisel cutters offer top performance. Smoother
cuts via offset depth gauges that stop cutters from driving into the
sidewall of the cut.

<pre>
LubriTec™ keeps your chain and guide bar oiled for less friction and longer life
Pitch: 3/8", gauge: .050", drive link count: 72
Blued Cutters deliver high-quality protection against corrosion

</pre>

And, you’ll also need to upgrade the bar in order to fit the OREGON
72LGX072G chain. If you want a professional quality bar I recommend the
OREGON 200RNDK095 — 20″ Power Match Bar.

<h4>Great info in this thread</h4>

<h5>Dallas</h5>

John, the 70’s won’t work on the wider Oregon bar. Remember, every
link in the chain is an extra 1/2” on that type of chain. Those little
home owner bars are so small you’ll wonder why you got one in the first
place. The 20” Oregon bar will add another 3+ pounds to the weight
of the saw, which changes the balance, and I like them a bit bar heavy,
less work for me.

Save your original bar and chains for anyone that wants to borrow the
saw…. It will save you hundreds in the long run.

My 28” bar and chain was a stretch, but I figured for the price I
could rebuild the saw and sell it as running on Craigslist.

If you want I’ll post the chains and bars that work on the Poulan,
but it’s probably easier to look up fitment for the Husqvarna 450,
455, 460, 470, and back track to the Poulan.

the Poulan is only a 50.2 CID but from the ones I worked on, the parts
are the same on the inside for the Husky Rancher 450 and 455.

<h5>Dallas</h5>

OK, here are the two I used:

20” upgrade to the standard Poulan bar and chain:

Oregon Power Match bar 200RNDK095 which takes the LPX Super Chisel
chain 72LPX072G

28” upgrade to the Poulan bar and chain:

Oregon Power Match bar 280RNDK095 which uses the LPX Super Chisel chain
72LPX093G

(BTW, the standard replacement chain in the LPX series is the 72LPX070G
for the factory bar).

<h5>sawyer335</h5>

Yes, Have been using three of the Poulan 5020AV saws for years for sawing
our firewood. Bought the third one as a spare for breakdown parts-but,
have had one clutch spring failure, and that is all. Did get the jet
adjustment tool, and haven’t changed the third saw over to a 28” bar
and chain yet, but will when I wear out the last 20” chain. Am 71 years
old, and a 28” setup means not so much stooping. Far easier, and the saw
works fine with the longer bar and chain. Get a full skip chisel chain,
Oregon 72jgx092g, and the bar is an Oregon 280RNDK095. Grease the tip
with two small squirts every fuel fill up, and I like 30 weight motor
oil for chain lube in the cold of winter.

The Oregon 30846 12 volt sharpener is what I use for keeping the teeth
tip top. Be sure to drop the end you hold a bit to keep the profile
right. Read up if you are not up to speed, there are many places on
the internet now that will tell you how to do it. I use both diamond
and carbide bits; whatever is on sale cheap. Never cut through into the
dirt; buy a cant hook and turn the log to saw the last bit. I also like
to roll logs onto a couple of small pieces of firewood to keep them off
the ground. Or, fall them onto branches from an earlier tree. Whatever
it takes ! Kind regards, Joel PS-if you buy from eBay, there is a seller
lately who has complete heads for dirt-cheap! Just take some time and
check everything out. Have three buddies who bought. One found some
loose screws (and one missing), one found a plastic bar spacer that no
one bothered to remove, and the third buddy got one with a loose air
filter, and the fuel tank about a third full of straight oil !! I gave
one of them my oldest 20” factory bar, and it still works fine. You
can easily grind the bars flat again when they wear.

<h5>Why the Granberg jig?</h5>

In contrast to the Oregon jig which is very flimsy because of a plastic
filing frame, thin wall construction, and difficult to read black-on-black
dials; the Granberg jig is very solidly built with all metal construction,
thick sidewalls, and easy to read dials. I started off with the Oregon
jig, but then gave the Granberg jig a try, was delighted, and never used
the Oregon jig again. The Granberg jig provides a complete solution for
all chain used on hand held saws.

<h5>Filing full chisel chain With The Granberg Jig</h5>

Flat-filed chisel chain, also called full chisel chain, is recognized by
experts as the fastest chainsaw cutting chain with the further advantage
that it retains its sharpness longer than the round filed chisel chain.

Use of full chisel chain has generally been limited to experienced
professionals who either use one of the expensive, specilized grinders
or have mastered the very difficult technique of hand filing the chain
using one of the special files. However full chisel chain is easily and
quickly sharpened in the field or at home with the Granberg jig as will
be explained here.
