Hi Nelson,

Thank You...

I think it's a pretty good design. It's a very rugged and durable
little machine. I've always liked the fixed bridge design for the extra
rigidity it provides. The only thing is has against it, is the small
cutting area. But this one was intended to be a small machine anyway. Not
everyone has space for larger machines. It's very portable and easily
enclosed for use in places like apartments where many people live....

The rails are 5/8" Thomson linear shafting. They're very nice precision
rails that don't flex at the relatively short lengths....14" for the
bridge/gantry, and 16" for the front to back axis....

(depending on how it's set up in software and positioned in an enclosure,
someone may call either axis X or Y...)

It uses common inexpensive Oilite bearings. The fact that they're
"cheap" is really just a plus, as they're ideal for these sort of small
machines. I've used them for many years in many sizes of machines,
including MDF , plastic and all metal machines. They will push dust and
debris away and act as self cleaning bearings. Easily cleaned if need
ever be.

The lead-screws are 3/8-12 Acme, with Delrin nuts. With the Probotix
driver setup shown, at 1/4 stepping, the machine will move at 80IPM,
though it's really intended to go around 30-40IPM max for tiny, precise
carving work.

It is an MDF frame. It's designed so the MDF frame holds the working parts
in place. At these small sizes, the MDF thickness...at 3/4" is enough to
provide very strong and reliable rigidity. The rails are held in place
using 3/4" black HDPE and cast urethane blocks. They won't flex at all,
and the combination of materials practically cancels any transfer of
vibration and resonances. Meaning it'll do very precise and highly
accurate work.

The painting is several layers of Rustoleum Hammertone paint.  It's taken
a lot of trial & error to finally figure out that the easiest way to get
a good durable and inexpensive finish, is to be very patient and let it
dry for several days.

The hammertone type paints give it a thicker, but stickier coating
pretty easily without too much "running" of the paint between coats.
The extra thickness makes a glossy heavier coating, but the stuff has to
dry a lot longer than the Krylon paints I normally use.  So I have to
give it 3-4 days to completely dry. It's well worth the extra waiting,
because the finish ends up very durable and similar to powder coating.

I didn't even bother sealing it like I normally do, because the extra
thickness of those hammertone paints sealed the edges well enough on
their own.

It's a very nice little desktop machine. I think it's probably capable
of some very fine PCB work...though I don't do pcb's myself.  It's strong
and rigid enough that it may do some light aluminum milling too.

The key thing is that all the parts are very, very strong and rigid at
these relatively small sizes.  The only hard part to building it is that
all the holes must be bored and drilled in *exact* right places to be
as smooth and accurate as it is. There's no 'slop' at all in the machine.

It has some nice weight to it at around 40 lbs. It should fit well
on most workbenches...it's 19" high, 19" wide and 24" deep with these
smaller nema 23 motors attached.

These motors don't have the extra shaft on the outside...which I wish
they did. I like to put handles on them for hand positioning everything
sometimes.

The inspiration for my design comes from Microcarve's MV2 and BBox
routers with a lot of my own changes.

Any regrets with your solsylva that you would have done differently?

Yes, I would have used more studs to support the pipes, only steel
angle for the bearing mounts (not aluminum), more reinforcing angled
steel on the beams from the start instead of adding it later. Using home
made laminated LVL's from the start instead of the 2X lumber. Starting
with a torsion box bed instead of the flimsy framing lumber. Basically
everything I had to do two or three times over to get the machine to do
what I needed. Think heavy. If you want a good wood machine, it should
be heavy. I think mine weighs about 1,000 lbs with half of it being the
torsion box bed.

Whatever you do, don't use those bent aluminum bearing mounts, use
half round nuts on the insides of the pipe because if you don't it will
distort, and despite what the instructions say, it is a problem. Solid
rod on the Z instead of hollow pipes.

The basis of the Solsylva design is a springy machine. Well, a springy
machine will chatter like crazy, so you want to design the springyness
out.

home made CNC. And I have the videos to prove it's more than feasible. If
you don't use at least the minimum chipload recommendation you're just
making aluminum powder and wearing out your tools. Don't believe me? I
have a thread stickied above this forum on endmills and bits and I discuss
my parameters for cutting aluminum and links to some example videos.

On a VMC there is absolutely no limit on how fast you can machine aluminum
other than the speed of the machine itself. But the principles are atill
the same. Use the recommended chipload to figure out your feedrate for
the particular tool, then adjust your axial and radial DOC to suit the
power of your spindle and rigidity of your machine.

Now if you have access to CAM with high speed trochoidal footpaths you
can actually overcome some of rhe limitations of a home brew machine
as I also show, though that software costs more than most machines
here. Barring that, for routers, single edge spiral o flute bits can
get you cutting aluminum easier with the higher speeds of routers and
spindles which I also demonstrate. I highly recommend Onsrud 65 series
because it utilizes a sweep at the bottom of the bit leaving a cleaner
pocket floor. Why single edge? So you can maintain at least a minimum
chipload using a router at feedrates reasonable for hobby machines.

And no, I don't recommend these parameters and rools from a VMC
background, but from experimenting and wrecking tools and workpieces,
at a time not too long ago when I could find no or incorrect information
was to be found.

To give you numbers, for a 1/4" endmill I use a chipload of about .0025"
which is just under the recommended chipload. I use a Bosch. 1617 with
a Super PID controller set to 12800rpm. That's 32ipm per flute. I now
use 2 flute endmills designd for aluminum, so that's 64ipm. Stepover
or radial DOC maybe 10-12% depending on job. For pocketing I use 1/2D
for DOC, and 1/4D for slotting or profiling. Why? Slotting means full
tool engagement, so the load on the tool is increased. When pocketing
you (hopefully) are using more of the flank which is more efficient at
cutting than the bottom.

I will use a single flute bit for slotting because of better chip
clearance, then finish with a 2 flute if I require a better surface finish
on the edge, but the single flute cuts pretty well for most my stuff.

Also, whenever possible, use stub endmills. Nothing guarantees failure
more than a tool sticking out an inch and a half, and you're taking .020"
passes. The closer the collet to the work the better.
