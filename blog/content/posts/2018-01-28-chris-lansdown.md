Narrowly acknowledged as the master of books written by me, I'm a
novelist, computer programmer, and the father of two very energetic
children. My favorite novel is Pride & Prejudice, while my favorite
author is G.K. Chesterton. In my own novels, I'm most interested in
exploring the complementarity of virtues among characters, though I
also work hard to make the plots flow completely naturally out of the
characters and the situations they're in. I try to leaven things with
humor, and somehow there seems to always be at least one character who's
interested in philosophy, theology, or both.
