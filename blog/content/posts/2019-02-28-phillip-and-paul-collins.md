  Paul and Phillip Collins on Contingent Divinity by Our Interesting Times 
</h3>

Paul and Phillip Collins return to Our Interesting Times to “Contingent
Divinity: The Golden Calf of the Universe”, an article that is excerpted
from their forthcoming book, Invoking the Beyond. We talk about how the
idolatry and pantheism of the ancient world is expressed today in the
forms of naturalism and evolutionary theory.

Paul with his brother Phillip have co-authored The Ascendancy of the
Scientific Dictatorship. Their articles are frequently published on
Conspiracy Archive.
