  Tax Them Till They Bleed - November 11, 2017 - by Raúl Ilargi
</h3>

The world has never seen such technologies. It has never seen such
intensity, depth of, or such dependence on, information. We are simply not
prepared for any of this. But we need to learn fast, or become patsies and
slaves in a full blown 1984 style piece of absurd theater. Our politicians
are AWOL and MIA for all of it, they have no idea what to say or think,
they don’t understand what Google or bitcoin or Uber really mean.

In the meantime, we know one thing we can do, and we can justify doing
it through the concept of non-productive and extractive industries. That
is, tax them till they bleed. That we would hit the finance industry
with that as well is a welcome bonus. Long overdue. We need productive
economies or we’re done. And Facebook and Alphabet -and Goldman Sachs-
don’t produce dick all.

When you think about it, the only growth that’s left in the US
economy is that of companies spying on American citizens. Well, that
and Europeans. China has banned Facebook and Google. Why do you think
they have? Because Google and Facebook ARE 1984, that’s why. And if
there’s going to be a Big Brother in the Middle Kingdom, it’s not
going to be Silicon Valley.
