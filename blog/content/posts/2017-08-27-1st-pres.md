<h4>Introduction</h4>

Why spend a fortune on Windows server software when you can get more
for so much less?!

SME Server is an Open Source Linux Server distribution and provides a
flexible, worry-free, secure, network and communications server solution
you won't outgrow. It is designed to be:

<ul>
  <li>Simple to setup and use: Installation and basic configuration
  takes less than 20 minutes, and every configuration option can be set
  via a web-based interface.
  </li>
  <li>Secure and stable to operate: SME Server only includes what
  is necessary, which translates into the entire ISO being around
  500MB. Stability comes from using proven, supported rpm packages and
  from an update system that notifies you with available updates.
  </li>
  <li>Cross-platform and extendible to meet future needs: SME Server
  already has everything necessary to provide the core services most
  people need to network Linux, Macintosh, and Windows systems.
  </li>
  <li>And it's completely free!
  </li>
</ul>

Exceptionally reliable and easy to use, SME Server can be installed and
configured in less than 20 minutes - yet it's powered by a secure and open
Linux platform that's fully upgradeable and customizable. Simply install
it on any standard PC and in minutes you'll have a robust Linux-based
LAMP server capable of fully replacing those expensive Windows server
licenses and providing a full range of services - including e-mail,
firewall, file and print-sharing, web hosting, remote access and more.

SME Server integrates easily with Windows, Macintosh, and Unix/Linux
clients, and within a Windows network environment. It's as simple to use
as a server appliance, but unlike a "sealed-box" appliance the entire
system is modular and extensible, so it can be tailored to the needs of
individual businesses.

<h4>Platform Specifics</h4>

SME Server v9.0 is the latest stable version of the award-winning
Mitel/e-smith based Server and Gateway, the world's leading open-source
server software for small and medium-sized enterprises. The heart of
SME Server 9 is based on the GPL'd sources of the unsupported developer
release of SME 7.0 alpha from Mitel, who is the copyright holder for
much of what makes SME Server what it is. Mitel's commercial offering
is known as the "Mitel Managed Application Server", and in the past
was known as e-Smith. Mitel has been very generous to fund development
of the alpha and beta versions and to keep to the spirit of the GPL by
sharing their source code freely.

SME Server 9 uses many packages from CentOS and RPMForge. CentOS 6 is
built from publicly available open source Red Hat Enterprise Linux v6.5
SRPMS and aims to be binary compatible. RPMForge is a collaborative effort
of several RPM packagers that build RPMs not included with CentOS. Almost
all of the packages that SME Server includes from these upstream vendors
are included unmodified. The purpose of doing so is to take advantage
of the stability that comes from the huge user base that uses these
packages, for security, and to allow automatic updates as soon as an
update is available from the upstream vendor. Security updates from
Redhat/Centos should be available until November 30th, 2020 for Centos 6.

SME Server v9.0 is based upon Centos v6.5

SME Server (known as e-smith at the time) was founded in January 1999
by Joseph and Kim Morrison. The company introduced the first version
of its flagship software product, the e-smith server and gateway, in
April 1999. By the end of the year, many thousands of e-smith servers
were running in countries from Fiji to Finland. Word was spreading
quickly among developers and systems integrators who needed a solid,
easy-to-use server for their small-business customers. In July 2001,
e-smith was acquired by Mitel Networks, but was later released as
an open-source product under the GPL licence. In May 2013 a new
not-for-profit organisation was set up to manage SME server. Due to
copyright issues it was named Koozali SME Server Inc. The word "Koozali"
approximates to Swahili for "rebirth". Future versions will use this
name. The distribution, which is based on CentOS, is currently entirely
funded by donations.
