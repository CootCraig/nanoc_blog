# DSLR

Decision:

* Replace Nikon D40 (d40 released March 2007)

#### [ebay purchase](http://vod.ebay.com/vod/FetchOrderDetails?itemid=181862575376&sspagename=STRK%3AMESO%3AVPS&transid=1401459040008&viewpaymentstatus=) $174

## Planned upgrades

* Nikon ML-L3 IR Remote Control Transmitter for many Digital Cameras 
* Nikon SB-400 flash
* lightweight Nikon 55-200mm VR.
* Nikon 18-200mm VR

Ken Rockwell - The D40 only autofocuses with the latest AF-S lenses.
My favorite Nikon 18-200mm and 12-24mm are AF-S and work perfectly. 

Ken Rockwell - If you have the right lenses, I'd get the D40 over the
others. Even if you have older lenses, the kit 18-55mm II lens of the
D40 is superb all by itself. Worst case, you'll need to blow $550 on the
brand new and much better Nikon 70-300mm AF-S VR instead of the cheap
70-300mm G. That's probably doing yourself a favor anyway.

Ken Rockwell - If you want a tele lens, try the new inexpensive and
lightweight 55-200mm VR. It's perfectly matched to the D40.

Ken Rockwell - I love my 18-200mm VR, but it costs three or four times
as much as the 55-200mm VR. The biggest reason to get the 18-200mm VR
instead of the 55-200mm VR is not to have to swap lenses to get from
one end of the range to the other, or to have instant manual focus
override. Optically they ought to be the same and the 18-200mm VR weighs
more than either of the others. Any of these are great choices.

Ken Rockwell - My 18-200mm VR is more than just a new lens. It's changed
the way I live and make photos. Some reasons my 18-200mm VR has changed
my life are:
