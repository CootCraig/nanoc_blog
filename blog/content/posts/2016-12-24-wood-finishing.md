Boiled linseed oil is also great for cleaning old dirty wood like
antique chairs or dressers. I like to buy old carpenter toolboxes at
yard sales and auctions and if they are really filthy I clean them with
a scotchbrite or 0000 steel wool dipped in BOL and they come clean but
have a beautiful aged patina. Also works great on tool handles.

Did ya get enough opinions? Want another?

I don’t use MinWax stains. IMO they have a tendancy to muddy the wood
grain. I add a few drops of TransTint a little at a time ‘till I get
the color I want. I also use TT in wiping varnishes and shellac.

Make SURE that ya don’t get just raw linseed oil. BLO has driers. The
raw stuff doesn’t.

The linseed oil can penetrate extremely deep by itself, but this takes
time. When you use linseed oil it must be applied in thin layers, and
best is several, then the oil can harden, otherwise there will come a
thin layer on top that has hardened, and then the hardening process stops.

So I think the reason that there has been this tradition to use turpentine
is due to speed not quality.
