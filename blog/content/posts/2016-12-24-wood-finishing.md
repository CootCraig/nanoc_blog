Boiled linseed oil is also great for cleaning old dirty wood like
antique chairs or dressers. I like to buy old carpenter toolboxes at
yard sales and auctions and if they are really filthy I clean them with
a scotchbrite or 0000 steel wool dipped in BOL and they come clean but
have a beautiful aged patina. Also works great on tool handles.

Did ya get enough opinions? Want another?

I don’t use MinWax stains. IMO they have a tendancy to muddy the wood
grain. I add a few drops of TransTint a little at a time ‘till I get
the color I want. I also use TT in wiping varnishes and shellac.

Make SURE that ya don’t get just raw linseed oil. BLO has driers. The
raw stuff doesn’t.

The linseed oil can penetrate extremely deep by itself, but this takes
time. When you use linseed oil it must be applied in thin layers, and
best is several, then the oil can harden, otherwise there will come a
thin layer on top that has hardened, and then the hardening process stops.

So I think the reason that there has been this tradition to use turpentine
is due to speed not quality.

<h4>
Reversible vs. Non-Reversible Finishing
by Alan Noel
Professional Wood Finisher 
</h4>

When I first started my shop some thirty plus years ago, I realized in
short order the need to understand which finishing materials would work
together and which would not. A good friend and mentor at the time was
very kind in that he freely shared his knowledge with me, even though
I was his competition. The following tips should help to clear the air:

<ol>
  <li>There are two basic types of finishing systems, reversible and non-reversible.</li>
  <li>Reversible finishes are LACQUER and SHELLAC. OIL-based and WATER-based finishes are non-reversible.</li>
  <li>Lacquer finishes are basically "finger nail polish." Each successive coat melts into the previous coat thereby creating one "homogeneous" coat when dry.</li>
  <li>Shellac works exactly the same way as lacquer. Each coat melts into the previous coat creating a homogeneous finish.</li>
  <li>All oil based finishes or ANY finish that is thinned with "mineral sprits," are non-reversible. This means that each coat will not melt into the previous coat.</li>
  <li>Water based finishes are the same as oil based in that they are non-reversible.</li>
  <li>To make all of these finishing systems work together simply sand the finish to be recoated with 320 or 400 grit sand paper. This will create fine scratches or "ruts" for the next coat to cling to.</li>
  <li>Be sure to sand all areas and remove the sanding dust with a tack cloth before re-coating.</li>
</ol>

This is a very simplistic explanation but one that will always work
without getting into the chemistry of these materials.

As always, practice on scraps first.

Homestead Finishing Products was started in 1994 by Jeff Jewitt and his
wife, Susan Jewitt. Prior to that time, Jeff and Susan had operated a full
time furniture restoration and refinishing business. Homestead Finishing
Products and the refinishing business were run side by side until 2004, at
which time Jeff and Susan devoted their efforts exclusively to Homestead
Finishing Products. What began as a very small catalog business later
developed to a full-time manufacturing and finishing retail business. We
are the originator and manufacturer of TransTint® Dyes, which are
sold world-wide for furniture applications as well as other diverse
applications such as musical instruments, aerospace, and flooring.

In addition to running Homestead Finishing Products and refinishing
furniture, Jeff Jewitt finds time to write and consult on a variety of
topics. A frequent contributor for over twenty years to Fine Woodworking
Magazine (Taunton Press), he has also written numerous articles for
Woodshop News, American Woodworker, Wood Magazine, Woodcraft Magazine and
Popular Woodworking Magazine. He has appeared 3 times on Scott Phillips
“The American Woodshop” television series and has won numerous awards
for his books and videos.
