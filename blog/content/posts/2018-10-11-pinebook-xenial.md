<h4>Application</h4>

<b>Caja</b> is the official file manager for the MATE desktop. It allows
for browsing directories, as well as previewing files and launching
applications associated with them. It is also responsible for handling the
icons on the MATE desktop. It works on local and remote filesystems. Caja
is a fork of Nautilus.

<b>Pluma</b> is a text editor which supports most standard editor
features. It also extends this basic functionality with other features
not usually found in simple text editors. Pluma is a graphical application
which supports editing multiple text files in one window (known sometimes
as tabs or MDI). Pluma fully supports international text through its
use of the Unicode UTF-8 encoding in edited files. Its core feature
set includes syntax highlighting of source code, auto indentation,
and printing support (with print preview). Pluma is a fork of Gedit.

<b>eom or the Eye of MATE</b> is a simple graphics viewer for the
MATE desktop which uses the gdk-pixbuf library. It can deal with large
images, and can zoom and scroll with constant memory usage. Its goals
are simplicity and standards compliance. Eye of MATE is a fork of Eye
of GNOME.

<b>Atril</b> is a simple multi-page document viewer. It can display and
print PostScript (PS), Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), DJVU, DVI, XPS and
Portable Document Format (PDF) files. When supported by the document, it
also allows searching for text, copying text to the clipboard, hypertext
navigation, and table-of-contents bookmarks. Atril is a fork of Evince.

<b>Engrampa</b> is an archive manager for the MATE environment. It allows
you to create and modify archives, view the contents of an archive, view
a file contained in an archive, and extract files from archive. Engrampa
is a fork of File Roller.

<b>MATE</b> Terminal is a terminal emulation application that you can
use to access a UNIX shell in the MATE environment. With it, you can
run any application that is designed to run on VT102, VT220, and xterm
terminals. MATE Terminal also has the ability to use multiple terminals in
a single window (tabs) and supports management of different configurations
(profiles). MATE Terminal is a fork of GNOME Terminal.

<h5>post 8 by Wizzard</h5>

Just edit "/etc/apt/sources.list" file and replace "xenial" by "bionic" or
better by "cosmic", then run "sudo apt update" and "sudo apt dist-upgrade"
and you are done.

Maybe you will have to solve some issues during upgrade, just read
carefully what it writes and do what is necessary, or paste it here and
we will help you.
