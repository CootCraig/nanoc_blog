The GMT800 Silverado/Sierra 1500 and 2500 (non Heavy Duty) (light pickup
trucks) were released in August 1998 as 1999 models. The "classic"
light-duty GMT400 C/K trucks were continued in production for that
first year alongside the new models, and the Heavy-Duty GMT400 pickups
(alongside the GMT400 SUVs) were continued through 2000, with 
<b>the new GMT800 Silverado/Sierra HD (Heavy Duty)</b> being introduced. A small refresh
for 2003 models was introduced in 2002, bringing slight design changes
and an upgrade to the audio and HVAC controls. The latter 2006 and 2007
GMT800 production units used the name Classic to denote the difference
between the first and second generation trucks.

<h3>
  GMT800 Heavy Duty/HD 2000-2007
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Silverado#Heavy_duty" target="_blank">wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet</a>
</h3>

The HD variant is a heavy-duty light truck. It is a strengthened version
of the Silverado/Sierra light-duty, and is available in the 1500HD,
2500HD, and 3500HD models. The 1500HD, introduced in 2000, offers a Vortec
6000 V8 with 300 hp (224 kW) at 5200 rpm and 360 lb⋅ft (488 N⋅m)
of torque at 4000 rpm with a Hydra-Matic 4L80E four-speed automatic
transmission. The 2500HD also offers the LB7 Duramax V8 with 300 hp (224
kW) at 3100 rpm and 520 lb⋅ft (705 N⋅m) of torque at 1800 rpm, the
LLY Duramax V8 with 310 hp (231 kW) @ 3000RPM and 605 lb·ft (820 N·m)
@ 1600RPM, and the LBZ Duramax V8 with 360 hp (268 kW) @ 3200RPM and 650
lb·ft (881 N·m) @ 1600RPM. Also available is the Vortec 8100 V8 with 340
hp (254 kW) at 4200 rpm and 455 lb⋅ft (617 N⋅m) of torque at 3200 rpm.

...

Towing capacity for the 1500HD is rated at 10,300 pounds (4,700 kg) and
can haul 3,129 pounds (1,419 kg) in the bed depending on options. Towing
capacity for the 2500HD is rated at 16,100 pounds (7,300 kg) with the
gasoline 8.1L V8 with 3.73:1 rear and can haul 3,964 pounds (1,798 kg)
in the bed depending on options. Towing capacity for the 3500HD is
rated at 16,700 pounds (7,600 kg) and can haul 5,753 pounds (2,610 kg)
in the bed depending on options. The addition of 4 wheel drive tends
to reduce the towing and carrying capacity by 200 to 400 lb (181 kg),
depending upon year and model. Other factors, such as options, can also
affect these numbers.

  <a href="http://www.f150hub.com/trans/4r70w.html" target="_blank">f150hub.com/trans/</a>
</h4>

The transmission was used in the Ford F-150 through the 2005 model year before being replaced altogether by the marginally stronger 4R75E. 

The Ford 4R70W automatic transmission was initially introduced for the
1993 model. It is derived from Ford's AODE, the electronic version of
the common AOD introduced in 1980. In 1993, Ford Motor Company, like
many automakers, began switching their name conventions and thus the
designation for the AODE was changed. One could argue that the modern
naming convention is more descriptive and favorable to less meaningful
designations. The nominal max input torque of the 4R70W/E is 700 Newton
meters (N-m), or roughly 516 lb-ft. The transmission was used in the
Ford F-150 through the 2005 model year before being replaced altogether
by the marginally stronger 4R75E.

If you're worried about it then you should stay away from the 5.4 3v. If
it was a well maintained vehicle then the plugs should have been already
replaced a few times probably and you should have no problems with them to
come. As stated above the 4.2 and 4.6 are very good engines with little
trouble. Even the 12th gen 09-10 have the potential for the cam phaser
problem which is probably the most asked question in this section.

It all depends on your abilities, capabilities, money, and willingness
to do the work. You can get a really good deal on a truck that can be
fixed up to tip top shape if you want to go that route.

<hr style="border: 0; height: 3px; background: #333; background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #ccc, #333, #ccc);">

Depends on your budget. If you're strapped for cash, an 11th gen can be
had pretty cheap. If the maintenance has been done, the plugs are a non
issue. Just remember that the 12th gens also had the same 5.4 issues,
though they were remedied with newer, redesigned parts. 5.0's still
have timing issues and the 1st gen 3.5 eb had intercooler issues. If
you want an 11th gen for just cruising around town, get a 4.2 or a
4.6. Those engines are pretty much bulletproofed, so long as they have
been maintained....

  3-valve 5.4 L
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Modular_engine#3-valve_2" target="_blank">wikipedia.org/wiki/</a>
</h5>

If you haven't seen any threads about changing the spark plugs in your
5.4L 3V 04-08, you haven't been here very long.

The culprit is a specially designed spark plug (and the head that
recieves it) that is commonly referred to as a "two piece" plug, due
to the lower shaft that is crimped to the body of the plug (the broken
piece in the above picture). Carbon deposits develop between this lower
shaft and the surrounding head, locking the lower piece in place. When
you remove the plug, the torque breaks the lower piece off. Ford changed
the plug and head design starting with the 11/30/07 engine build date,
correcting the issue. Unfortunately the new plugs require the new heads,
and as such are not backwards compatible.

...

Remember this only affects 04 (non heritage)+ which have the 3 valve
version of the 5.4L, 97-04H had 5.4L 2V.

Per the TSB: The engine build date can be read on the left hand cam
cover information sticker.

First post. Great board you guys have here.

For those who are contemplating doing the dreaded plug change, it does
not necessarily have to be a nightmare.

I changed mine at 97,000 miles yesterday with no problems whatsoever.

1) I did two Seafoam de-carbonizing treatments 1 week ago, along with
a tankful of Seafoam treated gas.

2) BEFORE attempting to back the plugs out at all, spray just enough
Kroil penetrating lubricant into the plug wells to almost cover the plug
bolt head. Cold engine, and let sit for a couple of hours.

Contrary to conventional thinking, the Kroil will wick down some even
with the taper fully seated. Don't ask me how, but it does. The can claims
that Kroil will find its' way pass openings as small as one millionth of
an inch. Apparently this is true. After soaking, I planned on backing out
each plug 1/8 turn, with the intention of letting it soak overnight. 6
of 8 came out with no effort. Upon breaking the seal, on the fist plug,
I kind of freaked thinking it must have broken off straight away because
of how easy it was coming out. The Kroil had turned the carbon build up to
"oil".

The back two passenger side plugs offered somewhat more resistance. In
this case, after backing out 1/8 turn, another quick shot of Kroil,
then let sit for 1/2 hour. With torque wrench set to 20 ft lbs, (well
below the 33 ft lbs danger mark) I simply took my time working these
plugs in and out 1/4 turn at a time until free.

Could be just lucky, but I suspect that the difference is letting
the Kroil do its work BEFORE moving the plug at all. Also, the second
Seafoam treatment produced very little magic smoke which along with
the relatively little carbon on my plugs compared to some pics I've,
indicates that the Seafoam treatment really does help. Could it be that
by backing the plugs out that initial 1/8 to 1/4 turn before using the
Kroil is weakening the bond of these two piece plugs right at the start
while the ground is still seized in the head? I suspect so. Again, the
Kroil had obviously found its way to the carbon build up in at least 6
of 8 in my instance with the plugs still fully seated.

There was no way I was going to have the Dealer attempt this after
being told $495.00 for a freaking plug change, plus $200.00 for each
broken plug. I figured I had much more incentive to take my time and do
this job carefully than the Dealer has. $64.00 for new Motorcraft plugs
from Advance Auto, $41.00 for new COP boots from Auto Zone, $15.00 for
Kroil Penetrating oil from Amazon, and $20.00 for freaking 8oz of nickel
anti-seize from the Ford dealer. Oh, and $12 bucks for the Seafoam for
the upper engine de-carbonization bonus. Done

I just sold my 4 door Silverado Z71 and I am in the market for a new
tow vehicle for my Scamp 19 goose neck (yes it has a goose neck). I
must have 4 doors, prefer manual transmission, and as best fuel economy
as available. I have been looking at Tacomas and that is where I am
leaning. I would take any of the new diesels but I can't find any
below $30K.

<h1>Ford F-250 Powerstroke / Navistar</h1>

<pre>
Neighbor Richard Smith 1997 powerstroke international 7.3 diesel
best ford diesel

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Power_Stroke_engine

The first engine to bear the Power Stroke name, the 7.3L Power Stroke V8 is the Ford version of the Navistar T444E turbo-diesel V8. Introduced in 1994 as the replacement for the 7.3L IDI V8, the Power Stroke/T444E is a completely new engine, with only its bore and stroke dimensions common with its predecessor (resulting in its identical 444 cubic-inch displacement). In line with the IDI diesel, the Power Stroke was offered in one-ton versions of the Ford F-Series/Ford Econoline product ranges. 

The 1995-1997 trucks use a two-stage cam-driven fuel pump, whereas the 1999-2003 trucks use a frame rail mounted electric fuel pump.

The 7.3L DI Power Stroke was in production until the second quarter of model year 2003 when it was replaced by the 6.0L because of its inability to meet newer emission requirements. Nearly 2 million 7.3s were produced from International's Indianapolis plant.[2]

The 7.3L DI Power Stroke engine is commonly referred to as one of the best engines that International produced.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Super_Duty#Diesel_engines

Available in both F-250 and F-350 pickup trucks as well as F-450 and F-550 chassis cabs, the F-Series was sold with optional PowerStroke V8 diesel engines produced under its joint venture with Navistar International.
