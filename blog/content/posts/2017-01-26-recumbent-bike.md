  RANS V2 Velocity2 (squared) Recumbent Bicycle
</h4>

New in 2000 the RANS Velocity squared (also known as V-2).

This bike is designed to be the fastest RANS bike made. It probably was
till the RANS Force 5 models arrived. It is a good value at under $1400,
(without a fairing.) The Velocity squared got a lower price and a less
expensive parts group in 2002, and it still works very well. The V-2
uses a larger diameter, thinner wall frame tubing than previous RANS
models, making it stiffer without added weight. The stiffening makes the
bike faster, particularly noticeable on sprints and climbs. Rotator and
Lightning have used large, thin-wall tubing for some time, it is harder
to work with but the ride is worth it.

Its 20" (406) front wheel fits a much larger variety of tires than the
20x1 1/8 (451) found on the Haluzak Hybrid-Race and the Easy Racers "SS"
models. The 406 is available from (several) thin racing tires to fat,
rugged touring tires and many types in-between, depending on the type of
riding you'll be doing this summer. On a tour you will find functional
spare tires in bike shops that think "recumbent" is another name for a
used bike (yes, this has happened.)

Tall riders, over 6'2" and camping tourists over 5'10" or so should
consider the XL frame version. Taller riders may find reaching the
handlebars to be a stretch, especially if they like to recline their
seat much.  The velocity squared offers comfortable high performance
and a good value.

Great ride, comfortable seat, excellent choice of components. With the
Mueller WindWrap in place, this is the only ride for our cold Vermont
early spring/late fall seasons.

subject: Serious about the Rans V-2

http://cycledifferent.com/experienced/angletech-rans-v-2-formula-st27-burnished/

After thinking about the rides and education from yesterday, the Rans V-2 seems to be the bike for me.

I will call after the store opens to talk some more.
