You really really need to go to Dexter Axle's site!! I have a 2010 Scamp with the 2200# Dexter Axle. And I'm 99% sure yours will as well. They have SUPER documentation for their axles- installing/packing new bearings, AND, testing the brakes! They give voltages, amperages, etc... and explain it all in detail. They tell you what to look for on the magnet, etc. You REALLY need to do this before proceeding!!

I can tell by looking, the brake area looks rusty. So you will probably want to use some "brake cleaner" and make sure the brake shoes can still pivot and not try to freeze up when applied. In other words, make SURE your brake shoes are "free". I had a slight problem with this last year...

I would still watch some YouTube videos for more tips. You may find some ideas on how to help with your brakes. If you have a 7-pin plug for your TOW, there's a way to test/activate your brakes with pins. But I'll stop there.... Get you a brake controller and Good luck.
