The goal is to have the old fluid not in the drain pan to get the chance
to be mixed, so the 3x drain and fill is not just recycling the fresh
oil just entered. I saw some posters simply just hold the brake and shift
through gears without actually driving the car. I'd rather drive the car
over highway to let it goes through all the gears and get the converter
locked/unlocked. If you are not in a hurry (i.e. have tranny code or
problem already), most dealers would just change it with oil change 3
times in a row. So the options are yours. BTW, each time it actually
takes about 3.5 quarts. My experience is 3 quarts may not or just barely
touches the lower mark. 3.5 quarts brings it to somewhere between the
marks with car parked level and not running as Honda calls for.

The only item I add to the ATF-Z1 in her 2002 Ody is some Lubegard Red.

I made the switch to MaxLife on my 2003 EX a couple years ago, and use
Lubegard Black. I got the 2003 used, it was a really good deal (the
owner was moving to Iceland!), and for some reason I thought to give
the MaxLife a try in that car.

I switched to a better ATF (Valvoline MaxLife Dex/Merc), which helped
quite a bit. Adding Lubegard Red on top of that helped even more. I
still get an occasional reverse engagement clunk on the first start of
a really, really, really cold day, but it's a rare event compared to
the way it used to be.

### Magnefine Filter


How is your Magnefine doing?  <a href="http://www.odyclub.com/forums/14-periodic-maintenance/128532-how-your-magnefine-doing.html#post633147" target="_blank">odyclub post</a>

One thing I never understand about Magnefine is that: since the Trans
already has an ATF filter inside the housing, adding a Magnefine may
be redundant???

I don't believe so, but I've been mistaken in a big way before, so just
my observations: my take on this is that not all of the fluid output
goes through the OEM filter on the top of our 2002 and 2003 EX's (not
sure of 2005 and later Odys).

The large volume of fluid running to the ATF in-tank radiator "cooler"
does not have a filter in the fluid path, so a Magnefine is a good place
to put this.

As well, that OEM filter looks like a cellulose filter, which can't stop
particles still large enough to be of concern. As well, it doesn't catch
the fine ferrous particles that can act as co-catalysts for oxidation,
which shortens life of the ATF. Granted, that ferrous stuff is still in
contact with the ATF when clumped onto a magnet, but the big plus is
that this very, very fine debris is not finely distributed throughout
the ATF to do its damage...rather, it's concentrated in one area with
much less surface area exposed to the fluid. For example, think in
terms of a thin layer of sediment at the bottom of a swimming pool,
versus having it stirred up throughout the water column.

Extra filtration always helps. Periodic fluid changes to keep the fluid
clean and the additives package fresh always helps. They're both good
to do.

#### AMSOil EaO44 not in production

Craig;

The EaO44 was obsoleted a few years ago. It had the same thread size as
the Ea15K20, but was both taller and bigger around than the Ea15K20. If
you prefer the larger filter, choose Wix 51626 or Donaldson P550935. We
stock both of these options.

#### Synthetic or non synthetic?  <a href="http://www.odyclub.com/forums/14-periodic-maintenance/153863-synthetic-non-synthetic.html" target="_blank">odyclub thread</a>

##### <a href="http://www.odyclub.com/forums/14-periodic-maintenance/153863-synthetic-non-synthetic-2.html#post741623" target="_blank">Odyfamily post</a>

You bet! Also, I don't feel we went off-topic, since the thread is
"Synthetic or non synthetic"....and the AmSOil filters use synthetic
engineered filtration media instead of a non-synthetic cellulose media.

AmSOil did a recent change to 20-micron absolute rating (first pass
measurement). Recently, some of their excellent 15-micron filters
were loading up with debris when used on engines with known sludge
problems. Ths is a situation that really didn't exist less than ten years
ago in automobile engines. In fact, several automakers have acknowledged
this new problem, and have extended their warranties.

More accurately, as automakers work ever more towards better thermal
efficiency and performance (usually requiring some pretty high operating
temperatures), we are beating the heck out of engine oil more than ever
before in ways we didn't think possible. In my younger days an API-SC
rated dinosaur oil would have been fine in any vehicle; that same oil
today would be a complete disaster in today's Chrysler 2.7L V-6 engines,
possibly the worst of any engine in North America in terms of poor oiling
design and sludge generation.

Here is a link to a <a href="http://www.amsoil.com/tsb/mo-2005-08-29-sludgeissues.pdf" target="_blank">PDF: AmSOil TSB</a>


Note that Chrysler is the only manufacturer that refuses to plus up
the warranty due to the many problems they've had and continue to
have. Never trust a "case by case" evaluation with Chrysler. They will
always blame the vehicle owner rather than own up to having poorly
engineered a driveline component of any type. I don't even think the
most current API-SN rating in a quality synthetic would be enough to
stop a Chrysler 2.7L V6 engine from doing this, so the "synthetic or non
synthetic" question is almost moot with them. That said, if you have
one and want to make it last, a quality synthetic oil and a synthetic
filter of sufficient size are the only way to go, IMHO.

20-micron absolute first pass rating is still excellent for an oil filter,
which is the rating for current AmSOil EaO synthetic media filters. Some
other makers also claim 20-micron with a mere cellulose filter, but after
searching the BITOG site, I found that most of the knowledgeable types
with engineering backgrounds confide that it is a misleading measurement
used by other makers based on filters that are almost completely blocked
with contaminants. The AmSOil rating is based on a new filter, so unlike
the others, it is truly an honest rating of AmSOil's synthetic filtering
media efficiency. BITOG is a very useful resource for these questions!

Again, from perusing BITOG, I've gathered that 20 microns is the maximum
size a particle in solution can still remain hydrodynamic, i.e., reside
within the lubrication film between two bearing surfaces in an automobile
engine and still not cause any damage. Good stuff, these AmSOil filters.

The EaO15K20 is a great filter. I still use it on my Accord with well over 180,000 miles (and even compression on all 4 cylinders still within spec for a new engine) along with Mobil 1. I used it for years on both Odys. I don't know if the EaO44 even is necessary on either of my Odys, since Hondas don't have sludege problems...even on the 2003 which does most of our summer towing duty. It most probably is not even necessary in the least, and the EaO15K20 is most likely the 100% answer. But, as much as I beat them up with kid hauling duty, short-short trips (which I try not to do, but end up doing anyway), and pulling a boat on 110-deg F+ summers, the Odys get the EaO44 just for my peace of mind, along with Mobil 1 5W30 synthetic.

AmSOil Universal Synthetic ATF goes into our Ody transmissions. I still have 2 cases of Honda ATF-Z1 for the 1998 Accord, and will switch to AmSOil when I eventually exhaust my stash.

Well, Oily Pablo (known as Pablo on the Bob is the Oil Guy Forums)
tried out the EaO44 intead of the EaO15K20 (the new name for the EaO20)
on his Gen 3 Ody. It is a much bigger filter, the gasket fits nicely
and does not stick out past the outer diameter of the pad where it rests
upon, and it is the same thread (20x1.5 metric). He cut one open, and it
does have a lot of pleats. AmSOil, as I understand it, has a reputable
maker like Wix or Donaldson make filters to their specifications (with
20-micron media), and more knowledgeable folks on BITOG think it is a
Donaldson-manufactured unit.

EaO44 Cut open (~13K miles ASM 0W-20) <a href="http://www.bobistheoilguy.com/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=1876910" target="_blank">Pablo bitog post</a>

The EaO20's exterior dimensions are 3.194" in height, and 3.252"
O.D. Exterior volume is 26.53 cubic inches. Rubber gasket is 2.475"
O.D., 2.173" I.D., 0.233" thick.

The EaO44's exterior dimensions are 3.812" in height, and 3.663"
O.D. Exterior volume is 40.17 cubic inches. Rubber gasket is 2.834"
O.d., 2.462" I.D., 0.200" thick.

In short, the EaO44 is about 50% larger in terms of total volume, and
it fits well without sticking out beyond the protection offered by the
frame of the vehicle. The rubber gasket was my only possible concern,
but it is a nice fit; it does not stick out (i.e., does not overhang
or protrude beyond the filter gasket mating surface on the car). The
radius increase from center of that gasket only amounts to 0.1795",
or just over 11/64 of an inch more than the EaO15K20 gasket.

That means any 2004 Odyssey with VIN 5FNRL18..4B051621 and beyond has a "good" A/T.

So here are the recommendations I've collected:

Install Tru-Cool LPD4544 22,000GVW cooler (from post by herrhaus)
Install Magnefine filter
Use Valvoline MaxLife High Mileage DEX/MERC ATF with Lubegard Platinum
Replace Transmission fluid every 15000mi with filter replacement(s) at 30000mi

Is anything overkill? Anything I'm missing.

#### Thread - 2003 Honda Ody 120K Transmission problems

joe, there are 3 possible fatal third clutch ATF flow defects that can
happen in any 2002-2004 Ody BYBA-coded tranny in Odysseys manufactured
prior to mid-2004. If his has all of them, plus the 3rd clutch steels
problem that is common to all of our A/T's, then he is fortunate to have
achieved 120,000 miles.

That said, if you change a clutch pressure control switch (or switches)
that may be in its final cycles of life, and that fixes it...well,
the van may be in for a long and happy life if you regain normal function.

No crystal ball here. Just praying for a good result!

##### 82-deg C thermostat <a href="http://www.odyclub.com/forums/14-periodic-maintenance/153863-synthetic-non-synthetic-2.html#post740364" target="_blank">odyfamily post</a>

You're correct...the 2002 has been our "primarily road trip Ody", while
my 2003 is the "always driven in town Ody". ken, I'm a little afraid to
look under the valve covers of the 2003 this week! The only item that
I think might help is that I put the 82-deg C thermostat in that 2003
some time ago. I have a Scangage II, and I'm always cognizent of the
coolant temp and making sure it gets warmed up fully, planning drives,
and school & activities & sports pickups / dropoffs so that I usually
have one continuous drive instead of many short drives with many starts
& shutdowns.

One thing I've found: even on cold days, the Ody warms up pretty
quickly. The 82-deg C tstat gives running temps usually 7-8 deg F higher
than the stock 78-deg C tstat. It might prove helpful.

Michael, you can't go wrong with Type 2 premix from the
dealer. Alternatively, I suppose any coolant that is compatible with
aluminum and has low silicate is okay too. IIRC, several members have
used Prestone successfully.

Replacing the coolant requires draining from two places: the radiator
has a hand-operated drain valve and the engine has a drain bolt on the
back side of the block that accepts a rubber hose to direct the coolant
into a container. After it's drained and refilled, there is a bleeding
procedure that's good to follow because of the rear heater system. That
was the 40,000-foot view. You can search for details here on the site.

Still, it's quite easy, but a little more difficult than either engine
oil or ATF.

Consider changing the thermostat and radiator cap at the same time. Both
have limited service life, although there is no specified maintenance
interval for them. My rule is to change them after 10 years or 150,000
miles, although my thermostat started running 5 degrees cool after just
95,000 miles. The instrument panel gauge looked normal, but my ScanGuage
showed the difference from normal.

##### maybe a 4 ft. clear 1/4" tubing <a href="http://www.odyclub.com/forums/24-1999-2004-odyssey/157482-coolant-good-02-how-difficult-dyi-change.html#post746276" target="_blank">nitely2 post</a>

Yep, grab a gallon of prestone long life coolant concentrate and a
gallon of distilled water at walmart and mix them 50/50 and you will
be set. No reason to pay any more than that. Well maybe a 4 ft. clear
1/4" tubing from home depot for the engine drain port reached from the
underside. Park car atleast 3 hours to cool engine before draining. You
will be using about 6 quarts total of your 8 quarts of coolant mix. Good
luck. Just recently replaced my radiator and thermostat and hoses last
summer and did this procedure twice to swap out the old blue honda for
the prestone coolant. Always good to measure how much coolant came out
before discarding.

If it's approved for use in aluminum engines, you should be fine. I've
used Prestone Extended Life coolant forever. I'm jumping on the bandwagon
of people who do an annual drain/refill of the radiator to keep the
additives package fresh (i.e., the added compounds that support water
pump gland seal lubricity, pH maintenance, and keeping particulates
suspended in solution, etc.).

It's just so easy to do with that little drain plug that can be opened
and closed by hand at the bottom of the radiator.
