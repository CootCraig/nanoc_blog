  Crio Bru ground coffee beans
</h4>

Crio, Inc. was founded in 2010 by Dr. Eric Durtschi, an insightful
entrepreneur who wanted to share his discovery of brewed cocoa beans as
a healthy and delicious alternative to coffee.

Named after the famed criollo cocoa beans, Crio’s flagship product
is Crio Bru, 100% roasted and ground cocoa beans that are brewed like
coffee. The inspiration for this drink originated thousands of years ago
by the indigenous peoples of Central and South America. It was served to
kings and prized for its energizing and restorative properties. In more
recent times it has been supplanted by coffee but as we realize the many
negatives of caffeine, the search for a new, healthier drink began. Crio
Bru is the original hot drink of kings and is now available for everyone.

Dr. Durtschi travels the world to locate the finest cacao plantations
producing the smoothest, most flavorful beans. He is also the inventor
of a new roaster and grinder design that optimizes the brewing process
to produce a consistently great cup of Crio. Now that’s commitment
you can believe in!

  Brewing Cocoa
</h4>

This is Brewing cocoa - it has been roasted and ground, with the husk,
for the purposes of making a hot brewed chocolate drink, and is not
suitable for making chocolate.

There has recently been a lot of buzz about various brewing chocolates.
Choffy and  Crio Bru are the two big ones that come to mind.  I’ve
received more inquires than I can count about what makes them so special,
if my roasted cocoa beans will work and how one can make their own hot
chocolate drink with minimum fuss.

Up until this point, I didn’t have any really good answers.  Now I
do and am offering a selection  of cocoa beans roasted and ground (with
the husk) for the expressed purpose of making hot brewed chocolate.

Your tastes may vary but I recommend starting with the following
proportions and times:

<ul>
  <li>4 T (35-40 g) / 8 oz boiling water</li>
  <li>Steep 5 minutes</li>
  <li>Press (assuming you are using a press pot - drip works ok too)</li>
  <li>Enjoy straight, with milk (or cream) and/or sugar.</li>
</ul>

I have only included the cocoa beans that I found made a good brewing
chocolate.  Some like the Papua New Guinea for instance, where it is
great as a piquant, smoky chocolate, simply comes through sharp and
acidic when brewed.

Finally, keep in mind this will not give you classic 'hot chocolate'.
Brewed chocolate is a different, yet very enjoyable, animal - enjoy it
for what it is, not for what it is not.
