  Cappadocian Fathers
</h3>

The Cappadocian Fathers, also traditionally known as the Three
Cappadocians, are Basil the Great (330–379), who was bishop of Caesarea;
Basil's younger brother Gregory of Nyssa (c. 335 – c. 395), who was
bishop of Nyssa; and a close friend, Gregory of Nazianzus (329–389),
who became Patriarch of Constantinople.[1] The Cappadocia region, in
modern-day Turkey, was an early site of Christian activity, with several
missions by Paul in this region.

The Cappadocians advanced the development of early Christian theology,
for example the doctrine of the Trinity,[2]:22 and are highly respected
as saints in both Western and Eastern churches.

<h4>Theological contributions</h4>

The fathers set out to demonstrate that Christians could hold their own
in conversations with learned Greek-speaking intellectuals and that
Christian faith, while it was against many of the ideas of Plato and
Aristotle (and other Greek philosophers), was an almost scientific and
distinctive movement with the healing of the soul of man and his union
with God at its center—one best represented by monasticism. They made
major contributions to the definition of the Trinity finalized at the
First Council of Constantinople in 381 and the final version of the
Nicene Creed, finalised there.

They made key contributions to the doctrine of the Trinity and to the
responses to Arianism and Apollinarianism.

"Such an experience seems to me to belong to the soul which loves what
is beautiful. Hope always draws the soul from the beauty which is seen to
what is beyond, always kindles the desire for the hidden through what is
constantly perceived... And the bold request which goes up the mountains
of desire asks this: to enjoy the Beauty not in mirrors and reflections,
but face to face." -Gregory of Nyssa, c.332-395

This great spiritual master of the fourth century was born as the general
persecution of Christians was ending. One of the Greek Cappadocian
Fathers (the other two were Gregory's brother, St. Basil the Great,
and their mutual friend, St. Gregory Nazianzen), Gregory has come to be
regarded increasingly as the most brilliant and subtle thinker and most
profound mystical teacher of the three. Whether or not one agrees with
Jean Danielou who saw Gregory as the founder of mystical theology in
the Church, there can be no doubt of Gregory's major importance within
the Christian tradition.

The Life of Moses has special significance because it reflects Gregory's
"spiritual sense" of the Scriptures. He maintained that the ultimate
purpose of the Bible was not its historical teachings but its capacity for
elevating the soul to God. Gregory saw the totality of the spiritual life
as an "epektasis," a continual growth or straining ahead, as in the words
of St. Paul, "Forgetting the past, I strain for what is still to come."

Gregory frames an immensely significant synthesis of the earlier
Hellenistic and Jewish traditions in this work. He describes the
spiritual ascent as taking place in three stages, symbolized by the
Lord's revelation of Himself to Moses, first in light, then in the cloud
and finally, in the dark. This translation and introduction, winner of
the Christian Research Foundation Award, has been expertly rendered by
Professors Abraham Malherbe of Yale University and Everett Ferguson of
Abilene Christian University.
