  Purple Barley - Organic
</h4>
A very old variety of barley that was almost lost to us, it has been
brought back!  It is hulless, making it easy to use for the home gardener.
Use it in soups and stews, for brewing beer, or ground as a flour.

  Japanese Buckwheat
</h4>
Although classified as a grain, buckwheat is not a true grass and
is unrelated to wheat.  A great choice for gluten intolerant people,
it contains no gluten.  Used in Japan for soba noodles, in Northern
Europe for blinis or porridge, it is a versatile crop.  It is also an
excellent cover crop and is loved by bees, which makes for a very dark
and distinctly colored honey.

  Common Oats
</h4>
Oats are a great staple grain, delicious and hardy cooked into a poridge
or breakfast cereal.  Oats can be grown as a feed grain for livestock
or as a cover crop.  An excellent choice for a late summer planted
cover crop.  Oats is a winterkill variety, so it is easier to manage in
the spring when you need to till it in.

  French Green Lentil
</h4>
100 days.  With dark green splotches on light green seeds, these lentils
are both beautiful and delicious.  Known for its slightly mineral flavor,
these French heirloom lentils retain their shape upon cooking and cook
slightly faster than other varieties.  An excellent choice for soups
and salads.  My favorite way to eat them is in a salad with sauteed
carrots and onions dressed with a light dijon viniagrette.  Lentils are
a cool climate legume.  Best planted up to 2 weeks before last frost
and do best in cooler climates.

  Burbank Hulless Barley
</h4>

50 seeds ~2 grams

Luther Burbank died April 11, 1926. 1927 the last Burbank Seed Catalog
States..."Final offering of Burbank Barley. One of Mr. Burbank's Greatest
grain creations. In the store-house where Burbank kept precious seeds
for his own use, we found a treasure that will delight farmer and growers
of fine grains...a few sacks of his hulless barley."

This was the last time this barley was offered to the public until
now... Restored back to commercial cultivation by Sustainable Seed
Co. in 2010. We are now releasing an improved variety that has 4+ stalks
(original had 2 stalks) and larger heads.

A six-rowed barley. 14% protein level. BetaGlucan 7.5% (very high)
(Lodge Scale of 7 )

Spring Planted. 4' stalks carry golden plump grain heads of immense
size. Excellent, rich nutty flavor. 2+ tillers (stools, basal shoots,
etc...) which is an improvement of California Hulless.

Luther Burbank states in his catalog that this was a selection from
California Hulless Barley. What that means is he took this already
known barley and selected for characteristics he liked. What those
characteristics were we don't know for sure. I'm still researching and
digging through his endless catalogs/papers locally, but a trip to the
Library of Congress may be in order for this and a few other varieties
I'm researching.

Improvement of a seed line was typical at the time. Heck, most seedsmen
today still do it. However, what made Burbank so controversial was instead
of keeping the original seed name and then calling it "new, improved or
_____(company's name) selection" (but leaving the original seed name),
he renamed it and normally after himself.

For instance, this barley was and is clearly California Hulless, but
it is also clearly bigger, taller and more robust than its original
state. Another famous example Burbank did this with was Golden Bantam
corn. He took Burpee's 8 rows of grains to an ear variety and bred it
up to 12 rows an ear. He then called it Burbank Bantam. He at least
left the Bantam name attached, but only occasionally mentions what it
originally was. In fact, he called it a "new bantam". This practice
brought critics to his work. However, he spent 18 years improving Golden
Bantam! Should he not be able to rename his work that was now different
from the original? There were also no plant patents in Burbank's day
and this was a way of branding his work. Hopefully recouping some of
the cost of 18 years of research.

I was highly impressed in that we planted Burbank Barley in very
infertile, sandy soil with no organic amendments added. Despite this it
did amazing! 0% lodging (falling over) noted. No major disease or pest
problems. Hasn't been offered commercially that we know of since Luther
Burbank did in 1926 just before his death.

1926 Luther Burbank seed catalog states...  "140 bushels per acre. A
tremendously valuable variation from the well known 6-rowed California
barley. The one barley for all purposes. No other barley of any kind
will yield as much as this..."

Decemeber 5, 1924 San Francisco Customer to Burbank states....  "We
received five pounds and harvested 600 pounds. 142 bushels per acre..."

Part of Sustainable Seed Company's Grain Restoration Project.

Sample Sizes Only. You will receive 50 seeds (that is double the number
from 2011). Please donâ€™t ask for larger quantities because we do not
have them. The idea is for as many people as possible to get started
and grow your own reestablishing genetic diversity. This allows many
people to get samples instead of just a few and hopefully will preserve
this cultivar.

  Avena Nuda Hulless Oat
</h4>
Spring Planted. 15-16% Protein Level (that is higher than corn)

Oats grow quick in cool, moist conditions. Used for hay or the oats
themselves. Hulless oats are perfect because no expensive de-hulling
machine is needed to remove the hull.

A must for any homesteader because it has so many uses. Perfect for
breakfast, in muffins or bread. Feed the entire stalks to horses, goats
or sheep for a high protein meal.

An 18-month study conducted in 1998 by the AAFC Research Centre in
Lennoxville, QC concluded that hulless oats could replace both corn and
the protein supplement in dairy rations with no impact on milk yield
or components.

Thresh and feed the seed to the chickens. There is no better way to
fatten up broilers or pigs for that matter.

Use the hay for the compost pile or as animal feed to ruminants.

Sprout them for salads or use them as fresh sprouted greens for
poultry. Oats have so many uses!
