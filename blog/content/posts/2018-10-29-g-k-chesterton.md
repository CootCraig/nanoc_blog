  Who is this Guy and Why Haven’t I Heard of Him?  by Dale Ahlquist 
</h3>

Gilbert Keith Chesterton (1874-1936) cannot be summed up in one
sentence. Nor in one paragraph. In fact, in spite of the fine biographies
that have been written of him, he has never been captured between the
covers of one book. But rather than waiting to separate the goats from the
sheep, let’s just come right out and say it: G.K. Chesterton was the
best writer of the 20th century. He said something about everything and
he said it better than anybody else. But he was no mere wordsmith. He was
very good at expressing himself, but more importantly, he had something
very good to express. The reason he was the greatest writer of the 20th
century was because he was also the greatest thinker of the 20th century.
