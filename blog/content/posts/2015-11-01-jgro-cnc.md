## jckstrthmghty

If you had access to a larger router then you should cut a joes2006
instead. The JGRO is good for those without access to a CNC router. If you
have limited room it's easy to scale down the joes2006. Nothing against
the JGRO, I have one and it has served me well but for me it's primary
use is to cut a joes2006 which is a significant upgrade. Supported rails
and all.
