Want to build a stone house? It's easier than you might think! Slipform
Stone Masonry brings to life the nuts-and-bolts of the slipforming
process featured in Tom's book Living Homes.

Slipforming is the process of using forms on both sides of the wall as a
guide for the stonework. The forms are filled with stone and concrete,
then "slipped" up the walls to form the subsequent levels. Slipforming
makes stone work easy even for the novice.
