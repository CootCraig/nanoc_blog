Dokku-alt is a Docker powered mini-Heroku. The smallest PaaS
implementation you've ever seen. It's a fork of original dokku. The idea
behind this fork is to provide complete solution with plugins covering
most of use-cases which are stable and well tested.

Install Dokku-alt on any Ubuntu server and deploy web apps, databases
and even more complex infrastructures without worries about security.
