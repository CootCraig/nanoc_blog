  Eat Real Food for Health and Longevity - Dr. Michael Greger
</h3>

Dr. Michael Greger is a nutrition expert, physician, and founder of
NutritionFacts.org, is the author of an excellent new book, "How Not
to Die: Discover the Foods Scientifically Proven to Prevent and Reverse
Disease."

In it, he examines the 15 top causes of premature death in the U.S.,
including heart disease, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, and more,
and reveals how to eat and live for a long healthy life.

The title of the book does not imply that you can achieve immortality,
but rather it refers to how to avoid dying prematurely, in pain, after
long, chronic, disabling illness.

What motivated him to focus on nutritional medicine was watching
his grandmother get well after being diagnosed with end-stage heart
disease. After multiple bypasses, she was sent home to die, with only
weeks to live.

As fate would have it, she heard about Nathan Pritikin on 60 Minutes,
an early lifestyle and alternative medicine pioneer. Pritikin has since
passed on but she made it to his clinic, which offered a live-in program,
and a few weeks later, she was walking 10 miles a day, and went on to
live another 31 years until the age of 96.

How could that be?

<ul>
  <li>"They put them on a plant-based diet, graded exercise programs; started getting them walking in 10-minute intervals, and just gradually ramped that up.</li>
  <li>This shows that a healthy diet and exercise cannot just change the structure of the arteries and clean up some of those plaque over the years, but actually change their function," Dr. Greger says.</li>
  <li>"You can get almost immediate improvements within days in terms of angina and some of these other problems ...</li>
  <li>And then, of course, Dr. Dean Ornish in 1990 published his Lifestyle Heart Trial, a randomized controlled trial that proved ... you can reverse heart disease, the No.1 killer – without drugs, without surgery – with a healthy diet and other lifestyle changes. That's what did it for me."</li>
</ul>
