#### <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkaP--4aQg" target="_blank">Tie and Use a 3-Way Slip Sinker Rig</a>

This is my favorite way to tie a 3-way slip sinker bait rig for bait
fishing on the bottom with minnows, shiners, suckers, nightcrawlers,
worms, hellgrammites, crayfish, cutbait, and other dead or live
baits. These 3-way slip sinker bait rigs each have a fluorocarbon leader
going to a hook and a breakaway mono leader (connected to another barrel
swivel that slides along the main line) going to a weight, and I use
them all the time to catch walleye, panfish, carp, suckers, catfish,
bass, pike, and more. I tie hundreds of these bait rigs every year, tie
all sorts of variants of them, and use them in most of my bait fishing
videos, and I think they have some advantages over standard 3-way rigs
and standard slip sinker rigs. I also tried to share (in this video)
some of my best bait fishing tips and techniques relating to the bait
rig that came to mind.

Next, you will need to select the right size, shape and the color for
the lure. As always, you want to match your lure to the forage. Use
crankbaits small, slim-bodied silver models for ponds that are full of
minnows or shad, big, deep-bodied chartreuse models for ponds full
of bluegill or medium-sized brown-and-red models in ponds with lots
of crayfish.

Use:

* small slim-bodied silver models for ponds that are full of minnows or shad
* big, deep-bodied chartreuse models for ponds full of bluegill
* medium-sized brown-and-red models in ponds with lots of crayfish.
