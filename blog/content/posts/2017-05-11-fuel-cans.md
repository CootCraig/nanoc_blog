VP’s 5-GL Motorsport Containers are made with only the highest
quality virgin high-density polyethylene, including 30% more material
than standard containers to withstand the roughest treatment. The

non-breakable multipurpose cap with rubber gaskets. Hose not included.

NOTE: The VP Motorsport Container is intended only for use as a rapid
refueling device for racing vehicles used in professional road and closed
course competition racing events. It is NOT a portable fuel container as
described by ASTM, EPA, ARB or other state or federal agencies. Intended
for racing fuel only; not to be used for street legal fuels

<h4>Amazon review by L. Burouon</h4>

We were using those gas cans from the big box stores and spilling gasoline
all over the place while fueling our mowers. The VP Motorsport jug is a
great improvement over cans with govt mandated safety features that do
not work.

We screwed a 3/4 inch PVC threaded nipple into the hole on top then
added a threaded elbow and another threaded nipple as shown in the
pictures. The threaded cap screws right on for a tight fit. Open the vent
and pour away. Five gallons drain in a fraction of the time of our old
gas cans and with a LOT less spillage. The large cap is easy to remove
and reinstall and hasn't leaked yet. We were so pleased with our first
jug, we ordered two more. They arrived promptly without damage.

The large handle and the shape of the bottom provide secure control
while pouring.

No reservations, we are pleased with these jugs for our purposes!
