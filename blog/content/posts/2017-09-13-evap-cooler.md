Aspen excelsior cooler pads, we are always looking for ways to improve
our own line of evaporative cooler products. Whether it’s our Aspen
Snow-Cool Premier Cooler Pads with Grid-Flo™ stitching; our exclusive
Loop & Lock™ closure system on our cooler covers; or our patented
product line of Mighty Cool™ Cooler Pumps, our innovations keep your
evaporative cooler running at its highest efficiency. In addition, we
also provide our customers with a complete line of cooler care products,

Aspen Snow-Cool™ pads have been known for years as the finest in the
market. Still, we knew we could do better. Cooler pads hold water, but any
material that doesn’t absorb water reduces overall cooling efficiency.

<ul>
  <li>We created the Premier Pad by starting with our pure Aspen excelsior. The open cellular structure of this excelsior allows our Premier Pad to hold more water. The result? More evaporative wicking area per square inch than any other evaporative cooler pad.</li>
  <li>We added Grid-Flo™ stitching, our exclusive all-natural biodegradable thread, that creates the most even flow of water throughout the pad surface. Special stitching creates fiber-stabilizing grids, which prevent hot spots that cost extra money to cool. Grid-Flo™ stitching also eliminates pad sagging that makes evaporative coolers inefficient. And, this new stitching requires fewer roof trips by reducing the debris that clogs pumps and filters.</li>
  <li>Best of all, Uni-Pad™ construction wets out the pad in a rapid and uniform pattern, making rooms cool quickly.</li>
</ul>

  DIAL 1540 115V Purge Pump 
</h3>

If you want this to actually empty out your cooler every 8 hours, it must
be plugged into an outlet that is constantly hot.  The way my cooler
works, is the pump don't run unless the cooler is on, so for example,
if I turn my cooler on and run it for 4 hours, and turn it off for the
rest of the day. Then turn it on for 2 hours the next day. Then on the
third day run it for a couple more hours, the pump will finally run at
the end of the third day. Every 8 hours. I wish the time on the pump
was adjustable. Because it is when the cooler sets for a couple of days
without running that the water starts to turn " swampy".  Otherwise the
pump does work as advertised.

For years I have hated cleaning the calcium off the cooler panels at
the end of summer. Adding this purge pump and a calcium inline filter
this year has made a MAJOR improvement -- very little calcium and the
purged water goes to my garden and trees. Excellent !!

This was real easy to install. I did have a hole in the sheet metal of
my swamp cooler for the mounting screw. If there had not already been a
hole there it would have taken just a little effort to drill one (not in
the bottom pan!).  The pump must work just fine, as I hardly ever noticed
it working- it's real quiet. It does come on every 8 hours like it says
in the description. We have real "hard" water here and it did seem to
help keep the mineral deposits down.  Winter hit here earlier this week,
so that's why this review is in the past tense.

Works good pumps out about 5 gallons every 6 to 8 hours. Sure made a
difference in calcium build up. Easy to install. I noticed others complain
that it was hard because you had to drill a hole. No big deal. Also I
suggest making a trip to a good hardware store and get stainless steel
bolt and nut so it won't rust.

This pump does exactly what it says it will. I read other reviews about
people mentioning that you have to drill a hole in your cooler, and I'm
not sure why they said this. Works great, no holes need drilling, make
sure to use the plastic insert in the end of the hose so water doesn't
keep siphoning from the cooler after the pump has shut off.

No on the blue plastic pads.
