Inkscape is an open-source vector graphics editor similar to Adobe
Illustrator, Corel Draw, Freehand, or Xara X. What sets Inkscape apart is
its use of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), an open XML-based W3C standard,
as the native format.

The historic baseline is the Sodipodi Hydra codebase.

## Calligraphy with Inkscape

Calligraphy

The earliest forms of calligraphy date back to cave-man paintings. Up
until roughly 1440 AD, before the printing press was around, calligraphy
was the way books and other publications were made. A scribe had to
handwrite every individual copy of every book or publication. The
handwriting was done with a quill and ink onto materials such as
parchment or vellum. The lettering styles used throughout the ages
include Rustic, Carolingian, Blackletter, etc. Perhaps the most common
place where the average person will run across calligraphy today is on
wedding invitations.

There are three main styles of calligraphy: Western or Roman, Arabic,
Chinese or Oriental

This tutorial focuses mainly on Western calligraphy, as the other two
styles tend to use a brush (instead of a pen with nib), which is not
how our Calligraphy tool currently functions.

### Carolingian

Inkcut is a free program for cutting vinyl and plotting vectors in ubuntu
linux. Inkcut sends HPGL directly to a vinyl cutter or plotter via a
serial or printer connection. It is free and easy to install and use and
it currently is implemented as an extension for the Inkscape SVG editor.
