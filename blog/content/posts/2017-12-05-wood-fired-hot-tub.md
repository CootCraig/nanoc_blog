Wood Fired Hot Tubs
</h4>

At Timberline Wood Water Stoves, we have partnered with Northern Lights
Cedar Tubs to provide you with a world class wood fired hot tub. The
craftsmanship and materials are second to none! Stainless steel straps,
Clear Grade “A” western red cedar and customized cedar accessories
make these the finest wood hot tubs found in the world.

We offer the traditional classic wood fired hot tub in 3 sizes ranging
from a 4-8 person hot tub. All our wood hot tubs come complete with
a fully insulated cover that provide a R14 heat loss value as well as
safety features such as an aluminum center spine to prevent cracking
from snow load or animals, child proof safety locks and marine grade
vinyl cover that has UV inhibitors to protect it from the sun. A hexagon
seating structure allows bathers to enjoy a social seating circle. The
special step in seat is ideal for entry as well as kids or those that
want to cool off but not leave the tub.

  DIY Hot Tub
</h3>

Want to create a relaxing oasis in your backyard for less than
$1,000? We'll show you with this easy DIY hot tub plan.

The idea of using a stock-watering tank for a DIY hot tub project has
been around for a long time, but all of the ones I’d seen were pretty
unattractive. I wanted a setup that was nice-looking, easy to use,
and economical. My hot tub dreams came together when I discovered a
wood-fired spa stove made in Japan by a company called Chofu and imported
by Island Hot Tub Co. Depending on how the soaking area is customized,
the setup I’ve designed can cost less than $1,000.
