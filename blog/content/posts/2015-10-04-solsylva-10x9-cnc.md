<a href="http://solsylva.com/cnc/10x9x4.shtml" target="_blank">10 x 9 x 4 Fixed Gantry Machine</a>

### Simple, Solid and Inexpensive

* Sturdy
* Easy to build
* Low cost
* Built with basic tools
* Made of stock materials

This fixed gantry machine uses bearings that ride steel rails. Bearings
also support the leadscrews. These features give a solid machine that
can use a trim router to cut aluminum.

### Construction

Only basic tools are required to build this machine. Tool list (on FAQ
page) The machine's body is made of 1x4 and 1x6 boards that are cut to
length and drilled. These boards are stiffer than MDF.  Materials.pdf

Most cuts are cross-cuts, and all wood cuts can be made with a power-miter
or hand saw. A table saw is neither needed nor missed.

The rails are black iron pipe, rigid conduit, or galvanized plumbing
pipe, which can be cut with a hacksaw.  There are no threads to tap,
and the steel rails are not drilled.

The table is sized so it can use half (18 inches) of a standard three
foot Acme leadscrew on the X and Y axes. This simplifies upgrades.

### Steppers and Speeds

NEMA 23 steppers move each axis. This is a standard size that is available
in many stepper and drive packages.  The prototypes used the HobbyCNC
200 oz.in. system. HobbyCNC also sells a 305 oz.in. system. Its extra
power is noticeable, but was not missed in machining the aluminum with
this 10x9 machine. Other stepper packages can be used.

The 5/16-18 threaded rod leadscrews gave rapids above 50 inches per
minute. The precision Acme leadscrews permitted rapids over 250 ipm with
the 200 oz.in. steppers.

The machine uses a trim router. Its power is compatible with the wooden
construction and the popular steppers and drives.

### aluminum Milled with the 10x9

The milled stock is 6061 T6511 extruded aluminum bare rectangle
(flat bar).

The edge cut shown on the 10x9 page used 3/8-8 four start precision
Acme leadscrews with anti-backlash leadnuts on the X and Y axes. This
was the only upgrade, and it added ~$140 to the price of the machine.

The proprietary stepper to leadscrew couplers, leadnuts and collar clamps
add up quickly.

### Precision Acme Leadscrew Upgrade

The edge cut shown on the 10x9 page used 3/8-8 four start precision
Acme leadscrews with anti-backlash leadnuts on the X and Y axes. This
was the only upgrade, and it added ~$140 to the price of the machine.

The proprietary stepper to leadscrew couplers, leadnuts and collar clamps
add up quickly.

The rails and bearings remained pipe and skate bearings, and the machine's
frame was stock spruce-pine-fir 1x4 and 1x6 boards.

Features

* GRBL 0.8c compatible. (Open source firmware that runs on an Arduino UNO that turns G-code commands into stepper signals https://github.com/grbl/grbl)
* 4-Axis support (X, Y, Z , A-Can duplicate X,Y,Z or do a full 4th axis with custom firmware using pins D12 and D13)
* 2 x End stops for each axis (6 in total)
* Spindle enable and direction
* Coolant enable
* Uses removable Pololu A4988 compatible stepper drivers. (A4988, DRV8825 and others)
* Jumpers to set the Micro-Stepping for the stepper drivers. (Some drivers like the DRV8825 can do up to 1/32 micro-stepping )
* Compact design.
* Stepper Motors can be connected with 4 pin molex connectors.
* Runs on 12-36V DC. (At the moment only the Pololu DRV8825 drivers can handle up to 36V so please consider the operation voltage when powering the board.)
