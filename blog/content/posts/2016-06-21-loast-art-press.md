# About Lost Art Press

<a href="https://lostartpress.com/pages/about-us" target="_blank">about page</a>

Founded in 2007, Lost Art Press is a small Midwestern publishing company
that seeks to help the modern woodworker learn traditional hand-tool
skills. Since World War II, traditional and effective hand skills have
disappeared from the home, professional and school woodshops in North
America.

Those quickly disappearing hand skills have been replaced by a reliance
on machine work, even when it is less effective, slower or sloppier. The
founders of Lost Art Press – Christopher Schwarz and John Hoffman
– are trying to restore the balance between hand and machine work
by unearthing the so-called "lost arts" of hand skills and explaining
how they can be integrated with the machinery in the modern shop to
help produce furniture that is crisp, well-proportioned, stout and
quickly made.
