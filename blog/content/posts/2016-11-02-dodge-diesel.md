3.9L Cummins 4BT

The Cummins 4BT is essentially a 5.9L 12v Cummins minus two
cylinders. This 3.9L, 4 cylinder, inline diesel was commonly used in
commercial van applications (popular application for Chevy Step Vans -
think bread delivery trucks), as well as a variety of construction and
agricultural equipment. Generous amounts of torque in a small package
make the 4bt common for engine swaps in Jeeps & small trucks/SUVs.

The 4BT is dimensionally similar to the 6BT, save for a much shorter
length. The pistons, injectors, connecting rods, and valvetrain design
are straight off of the 12v Cummins. Because inline 4 cylinders are
not inherently balanced like inline 6 cylinder engines, the engine is
noticeably harsher than its larger brother. The engines can be found in
applications with up to a 16,000 lb GVWR, which should serve as a limit
for anyone whom plans to use the engine in a custom application.

## First Generation - 3.9L/4BT

The 3.9L/4BT Cummins is an engine in the same family as the 5.9 liters
(360.0 cu in) Cummins turbodiesels. The 3.9L/4B is an inline four-cylinder
turbodiesel that was popular for many step van applications, including
bread vans and other commercial vehicles. It has also gained popularity as
an engine swap into smaller trucks. The lowest powered 4B produces 55 hp


## 6BT

The 5.9 liters (360.0 cu in) 6BT, aka the Cummins "12-valve" was the
first member of the "B" engine family to be used in a light truck
vehicle. The 6BT used Robert Bosch GmbH fuel systems, injector, and
VE rotary pump and P7100 inline injection pumps. Some early 6BT's were
supplied with CAV rotary pumps instead, before the Bosch system became
the sole standard. This engine started life in 1984 designed as an
agricultural engine, for use in Case agricultural equipment.
 After 1989, the 6BT engine was used in light duty,
medium duty and select heavy duty trucks and buses.

Appearing in the 1989–1998 Dodge Ram pickup truck, it became a popular
alternative to the large V8 gasoline engines normally used in full-size
pickup trucks, since it produced the torque at low engine speeds, and
significantly better fuel mileage. During that time, the Dodge Ram was
the only diesel pickup that featured Direct Injection and did not rely
on glowplugs for cold weather starting.

## ISB 5.9

The 5.9 liters (360.0 cu in) ISB (Interact System B) is one of the largest
straight-six engines used for light truck vehicles, and the improved
high output 600 version was on the Ward's 10 Best Engines list for 2004.

One unusual feature of the ISB is that it is a multi-valve pushrod engine
design. The engine displaces 5,883 cubic centimetres (359.0 cu in),
with a 102.0 millimetres (4.02 in) cylinder bore and 120.0 millimetres
(4.72 in) piston stroke. A turbocharger is used to increase the output
in the high-compression (17.2:1 in recent versions) diesel. It is an
all-iron engine with forged steel connecting rods, an assembled camshaft,
and a cast aluminum intake manifold. The engine is produced in Columbus,
Indiana.

The ISB uses electronically controlled Robert Bosch GmbH fuel systems,
unlike the 6BT systems which were mechanical. Early ISB engines utilize
Bosch injectors and a Bosch VP44 high pressure pump. Later ISB designs
have common rail fuel injection, Bosch injectors, and a Bosch CP3 high
pressure pump


## Dodge Ram ISB

Midway through model year 1998, the Dodge Ram switched from the 6BT to
the ISB to meet updated emissions requirements. Like other ISB's, these
engines started out using the Bosch VP44 rotary injection pump. The
VP44 setup meant that timing and fuel could be precisely controlled,
which led to cleaner emissions. However, VP44 failure rates were higher
than the older P7100 injection pump. The compression ratio in these
engines was 17.2:1. The 1998–2000 ISB was rated at 215 horsepower
(160 kW; 218 PS) and 420 pound-feet (569 N·m) when equipped with the
47RE automatic transmission. The 1998 ISB was rated at 235 horsepower
(175 kW; 238 PS) and 460 pound-feet (624 N·m) when equipped with the
manual transmission. The 1999–2000 ISB was rated at 235 horsepower
(175 kW; 238 PS) and 460 pound-feet (624 N·m) when equipped with a
manual transmission. For the 2001–2002 model years, a standard output
and a high output ISB Cummins engine were offered. The standard output,
which was the same as the previous engines was rated to 235 horsepower
(175 kW; 238 PS) and 460 pound-feet (624 N·m) when equipped with either
a manual transmission or automatic. The high output ISB was rated at
245 horsepower (183 kW; 248 PS) and 505 pound-feet (685 N·m), with
only a NV5600 six-speed manual transmission available. The high output
engine was different in a few ways from the standard output engine;
it had higher compression (17.1:1), powdered metal valve seat inserts,
a larger flywheel, the Bosch fuel system was reworked to allow higher
fuel flows, and fuel-injection timing was altered. Also in 2001 a new
cam gear was introduced thus eliminating the need for a crank position
sensor on the later 01-02 models

## Dodge Ram ISB CR

For the 2003 model year, the Cummins was introduced with Bosch high
pressure common rail fuel injection, again increasing power output. On
automatic equipped vehicles, the 47RE was upgraded internally to increase
durability and torque capacity, now known as the 48RE. The 2003 rating
for the Dodge truck was released at 305 horsepower (224 kW; 308 PS)
and 555 foot-pounds (752 N·m). Midway through the 2004 model year, the
Cummins 600 was introduced, producing 325 horsepower (242 kW; 330 PS)
at 2,900 rpm and 600 pound-feet (813 N·m) at 1,600 rpm. This engine
was noticeably quieter than the previous engines

## ISB 6.7

The B6.7 is the latest version of the B Series. It is currently the
largest straight-six engine produced for a light duty truck. It produces
350 horsepower (261 kW; 355 PS) and 650 pound-feet (881 N·m) in the
2007.5 and newer Dodge 2500/3500 pickup trucks with the Chrysler-built
six-speed 68RFE automatic transmission built at the Kokomo Transmission
plant in Kokomo, Indiana. Engine torque is slightly reduced with the
Mercedes G56 6-speed manual transmission at 350 horsepower (261 kW; 355
PS) and 610 pound-feet (827 N·m). The 2007 and newer 3500 Cab & Chassis
trucks only get the 305 horsepower (227 kW; 309 PS) and 610 pound-feet
(827 N·m) version of the B6.7, whether it has the Aisin AS68RC or the
Mercedes G56 6-speed manual transmission. As for the 2008 4500/5500
medium duty Chassis Cabs or the Sterling Bullet Trucks, they receive the
350 horsepower (261 kW; 355 PS) and 610 pound-feet (827 N·m) version of
the B6.7, whether it has the Aisin AS68RC or the Mercedes G56 6-speed
manual transmission. Late model 2011 Ram trucks produce 350 horsepower
(261 kW; 355 PS) and 800 pound-feet (1,085 N·m), with the exhaust brake
rating boosted from 150 horsepower (112 kW; 152 PS) to 222 horsepower
(166 kW; 225 PS).[5] This motor is also use in classic trucks such as
the Freightliner M2. In this application, it is commonly paired with an
Allison automatic or 6-speed syncromesh manual transmission
