  Cutting Board Care
</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Wash your cutting board frequently in warm to hot soapy water then rinse thoroughly. Dry the board immediately after and let sit on the cutting board feet. The feet on the bottom of the cutting board help prevent moisture buildup and expanding the wood over a long period of time. </li>
  <li>The best place for the cutting board is on the counter top. This allows for good airflow around the board so that it can breathe.</li>
  <li>End grain cutting boards need to be reconditioned with mineral oil and bees wax every few months depending on how often the board is used. For heavy daily use, re oil the cutting board every month or as often as desired. Cutting board oil can be purchased from a variety of stores such as home depot, chef central, or any store that stocks wood cutting boards. Look for mineral oil or a combination with bees wax as they will help to condition your board. I recommend heating the oil to warm before applying. This will allow for a greater saturation and will absorb more into the wood of the cutting board. </li>
  <li>If your cutting board retains any odors, there are a number of natural remedies to help mitigate any smells. Cutting a lemon in half, and rubbing the oil over the board does wonders. This also works with salt, baking soda, and vinegar. Apply your choice and let sit for a good 20 minutes. After wash in the sink with soap and warm water. Repeat if necessary. </li>
</ul>
