  My Book (The Bible), is my Body And the Seven Seals, my Chakras.
</h4>
The first church is the church of Ephesus. It is located in the coccygeal
cavity within which lies the sacred serpent known as the Kundalini,
or the metal snake. It is the bronze snake that healed the Isralites
while in the wilderness. It is connected to the Root or Muladhara chakra.

When the serpent reaches the prostate, it awakens the second church
Smyrna, and we aquire power over water and storms. Smyrna is connected
to the Sacral Chakra or Swadhistana.

When the sacred serpent rises in the central Chanel of the spinal column
to the level of the navel, the third church, the Church of Pergamum,
is awakened. We then acquire power over lightning, fire and erupting
volcanoes. We can command volcanoes, and they obey us. We can command
fire, and the universal fire obeys us. Pergamum is connected to the
Solar Plexus or Chakra Manipura.

When the snake reaches the heart the Church of Thyatira is awakened. This
church gives us power over cyclones, over the breeze, and over
hurricanes. Thyatira is connected to the Heart Chakra or Chakra Anahata.

When the sacred snake reaches the level of the throat, we can hear the
speach of the angels, the words of the souls of the dead, etc. This
is the Curch of Sardis. Sardis is connected to the Throat Chakra or
Vishuddha Chakra.

When the Sacred snake rises through the spinal column and reaches as high
as the brow, then we can see things of the other world: astral light,
the souls of the dead, archangels, seraphin, powers, virtues, thrones,
etc. This is the Church of Philadelphia and it is connected to the Brow
Chakra or Ajna Chakra.

When the snake reaches the upper part of the cranium, the Church of
Laodicea opens. This is the diamond eye. The one who opens this eye knows
all the things of heaven and earth. He becomes terribly divine. He sees
everywhere; he is aware of everything. Laodicea is connected to the
Crown Chakra or Sahasrara Chakra.

After this, the souls unites with the Innermost and becomes a master,
a prophet, wise man, enlightened being, possessor of power. He sees all,
hears all, and ignores nothing.
