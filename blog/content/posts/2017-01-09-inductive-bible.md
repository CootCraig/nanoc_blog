<h5>
Review - Worthy Sequel to Methodical Bible Study - By A. S. Keir
</h5>

During my senior year at Asbury Seminary (1983), I had a conversation with
Dr. Robert Traina, whose book "Methodical Bible Study" was the precursor
to this volume. In that conversation, Dr. Traina expressed an interest
in writing a sequel to his book - one that would address the most glaring
weakness of that work; His sequel would explain the step-by-step procedure
for doing inductive Bible study - the procedure he so effectively taught
in his seminary classes. This book fulfills Dr. Traina's intentions in
exemplary fashion. Undoubtedly, this book will be the standard textbook
for college and seminary classes for decades to come.

It is difficult to know how much Dr. Traina and Dr. Bauer collaborated on
this volume given that Dr. Traina died in November, 2010. His contribution
to this volume might very well be the lecture materials he presented
in his classes. If that is the case, Dr. Bauer has done an commendable
job of elaborating on those notes, filling in inevitable gaps that occur
when explaining such a complicated process to beginning students. Those
of us who studied under Dr. Traina (I majored in English Bible under his
tutelage), will realize when reading this book that this is Dr. Bauer's
book. He is to be commended for an excellent volume.

Dr. Bauer divided his volume into 5 parts. An introductory unit explaining
the philosophy of inductive study contains the most glaring weakness
of the book. I would like to have seen a chapter on why we study the
Bible. In my own teaching, my students cannot articulate why they study
the Bible apart from broad generalities. Why we study the Bible dictates
the method we use to study it.

The next four parts explain in detail the four major steps of Bible
study: Observation and Asking, Answering or Interpretation, Evaluating
and Appropriation (what we have often called "Application", and the
most neglected step of all, Correlation. A lengthy appendix addresses
significant issues related to the inductive method.  The extensive
bibliography at the end is thorough.

Two other weaknesses come to mind: First, the book references a website
on the inductive method, but the website needs more development to
be useful. Second, in my conversation with Dr. Traina, he told me
that he intended to provide a model of inductive study in his second
volume. While this book does contain very helpful examples, it would be
considerably more helpful if it provided a model of inductive study. The
website would be a good place to provide such a model. My own website
([...]) will provide such a model soon.
This book is not for laypeople (See David L. Thompson's book, Bible Study that Works for an excellent resource for laypeople). It will be widely used in academia. And, despite its thorough explanation of inductive methodology, it does not take the place of interaction between a qualified instructor and his or her students. That being said, I highly recommend this volume.


Many people spend time studying the Bible, but few are able to study
the Bible systematically and inductively. In Bible Study That Works
David Thompson outlines and demonstrates a method of Bible study
which is consistent in its approach and not controlled by theological
presuppositions. This method, often referred to as the "Inductive Bible
Study" method, was developed and taught by Wilbert Webster White at The
Biblical Seminary in New York. From there the method was transplanted
to several other seminaries such as Princeton and Union (Virginia), and
taught around the world by organizations such as InterVarsity Christian
Fellowship. Bible Study That Works is the most readable and complete
introduction to this method available today.
