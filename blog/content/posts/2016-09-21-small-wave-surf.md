I want to build a surfersteve small wave board.

Craig: weight 175# height 5'8" board 7'8"

(175.0 / 25.0) * 0.5 = 3.5 cu. ft. (99 liters)

# Possible blanks

## US Blanks 8'2"AX

<a href="http://usblanks.com/catalog/fun-boards/8-2-ax/" target="_blank">usblanks.com/catalog</a>

</ul>

# Fins

## <a href="http://www.surfersteve.com/smwavedesign.htm" target="_blank">surfer steve comments</a>

On the newer models, for surfers under 160 lbs., the twin fins are modified parallelograms raked at 20 degrees, 3" wide, 6" long (as seen in the green tracing below) - these can be cut from 7" molded cut away fins installed in Fins Unlimited Boxes cut to 5&1/2" long and installed 1&1/8" (or closer) from the rail edge. The boxes are installed with the base higher on the tail end, in order to tilt the fin more towards 20 degrees (more upright, less rake). If over 160 lbs., use 7" molder cutaway fins full size, but do install boxes 1&1/8" from the rail edge, with the base higher on the tail end.

## POLYSTYRENE 

I like extruded polystyrene but, it may not be worth the extra effort.
Expanded polystyrene is easier to find, can be bought in nearly any
thickness and length (blocks), is better suited to a stringerless
blank, and is sold in partially pre-shaped blanks.  Remember, you can
buy polystyrene block (EPS or XPS) in one solid sheet, at the minimum
thickness of your board, bend it after shaping, and save about 75% of
the cost, of a pre-shaped blank (this is the cheapest and hardest way
to make your own blank).

 ...

To make a board that is almost impossible to dent or delaminate,
consider the following:  Puncture or drill the blank every 2" (bottom
to top) with 1/8" drill bit or 1/8" steel rods.  Make a puncture tool
by first drilling 1/8” holes in a 6”x 6”x 5/8” piece of wood.
Insert 1/8”x 3 - 4” steel rods (9 rods) into holes in wood, and epoxy
in place.  The holes in the foam will fill with resin when laminating,
bridging the top and bottom together (do this only with uscomposites
Klear Kote Epoxy, as it is much thicker than most other resins)..  On the
first lamination, wipe the resin, which will drip out the opposite side
of the holes, when it gels. Also; 3/16" holes can be filled with 3/16"
bamboo barbeque skewers, available at most grocery stores - this method
will work with any resin (see TIPS chapter, DELAMINATIONS section).
This has been tested since 2005.  Please do not do this in order to
reduce cloth amounts.

 ...

Some people are using 2 lb./cu. ft.  polyurethane block foam to build
surfboards. My friends and I have tried it numerous times.  We are sure
you will like 2lb/cu.ft. polystyrene block foam better.  It is stronger
and less expensive.  2lb extruded polystyrene is 25psi.

 ...

One more alternative is to use 2lb./cubic foot (25psi - pounds per square
inch) extruded polystyrene foam (XPS) - Dow Square Edge, or "blue board".

and less expensive.  2lb extruded polystyrene is 25psi.  This foam is
also available in 40, 60, 80, and 100psi.  Although the tendency to use
lighter foams and thicker laminates is now more prevalent, I believe there
is good reason to experiment with the higher psi foam.  The 60psi foam
is only 3lb/cu.ft (this is about twice as strong as standard polyurethane
surfboard foam of the same weight).  Those who have tried the 40 and 60psi
foam claim this will allow a builder to reduce the cloth approximately by
half and have a stronger, and/or  lighter  stringerless board.  This is
unlikely to save money - the extra cost of the foam is more than the
savings in cloth. and, you will not be able to bend 40 or 60 psi foam.
Please use the 2lb. type for your first block foam board.

## misconceptions

<a href="http://www.surfersteve.com/misconceptions.htm" target="_blank">surfersteve.com/misconceptions</a>

Recommendation:  Ignore the flexibility debate and make a relatively stiff,
durable surfboard (minimum 1-6oz. "E".top and bot.w/ 6oz. deck patch)

Concentrate on finding the length, width, and thickness which is best
suited to your weight and waves, then fine tune the rocker and fin set up.
After that, experiment with every new idea you fancy.

Although sharp, downturned rails are much better for ripping and carving,
for the type of surfing the small wave design was made for, a round rail
is preferable.

<pre>
MONEY QUOTE:
A surfer used to a 9' longboard could transition to an 8'6" x 25.5"
x 3.25" small wave design for a 170 lb. rider.
</pre>

There is no one optimum board.  The optimum design will be different
for each person and each type of wave.  Allow a suggestion however;
a generally wider, thicker shape.  Although the small wave design is
not optimum for fast, powerful surf, the average surfer may derive some
benefit from a modification of the design.  With an open mind, the average
surfer will find a compromise of the measurements from the SMALL WAVE
DESIGN chapter useful.  A surfer used to a 9' longboard could transition
to an 8'6" x 25.5" x 3.25" small wave design for a 170 lb. rider.  If this
is too extreme to accept, consider using the measurements from a favorite
longboard shape, changing the length to 8' 6" and the thickness to 3.25"
for a 160 lb. rider).  For each 15 lbs. of body weight change, add or
subtract 1/4" in total board thickness (through most of the entire board -
not just the middle).  A thruster could be designed 1/4" thicker and/or
1&1/2" wider.  Note:  the small wave design measurements (same length
and thickness) support a heavier surfer (use 20 lbs. per 1/4" change)
because the board (especially the tail) is much wider.  Please refer to
the DESIGN chapter for more information on how to adjust measurements.

## Tips

<a href="http://www.surfersteve.com/tips.htm" target="_blank">surfersteve.com/tips</a>

Do keep it simple on your first board by doing the following:

<ol>
  <li>Use mostly hand tools.</li>
  <li>Make the rails round and the bottom and top flat - side to side.</li>
  <li>No wood stringer (if possible).</li>
  <li>No artwork.</li>
  <li>No gloss coat.</li>
</ol>

Do build to last.  Do use more cloth than what is on standard production
boards.  As oil prices, and surfboard prices, continue to rise, so will
the desire for a more durable surfboard. Consider 6oz. "E" top and bottom
with a 6oz. deck patch as minimum. 4oz. "S" top and bottom with a 4 oz
deck patch is an equal minimum.

Do get your hands on the materials (foam, cloth, and resin) as soon as
possible, and practice.  Surfboard building can not be learned by only
reading and listening.  Many of the details that are hard to understand
will become clear only when you practice.  For instance;  there is no
way to explain how to shape a rail or wrap cloth around a rail – you
must get the feel of it.  Practice.

Do consider buying a premade board, especially if you want a popular
shape.  The best reasons to make your own board are:  saving money,
making a non conventional shape, or enjoyment of the process.  It is
questionable to buy a popular shape from a custom board building shop.
Custom shops are best used for custom designs.  The popular models by
Surftech, Southpoint, and Bic are usually more durable, and often cheaper
than custom shop boards.

I'm looking for a source for a single straight cut EPS block to fabricate a surfboard.

requirements are:

* Block density of 2lb./cubic foot (25psi - pounds per square inch)
* Block thickness of the desired board maximum thickness.

25psi is recommended to allow using weights to bend/rocker the nose and tail.

For example a straight cut block (blank) dimensioned 7'6 x 27" x 4".

The length and width could be cut by me, but I'm assuming you can easily cut all 3 dimensions at your facility.

Can you supply this?

What would be the price of the block and shipping?

I live in Pueblo, CO and would be happy to pick up the block at a nearby shipping office, perhaps in Pueblo, Colorado Springs or Denver.

Thank you,
Craig Anderson

Ok, So I'm Not A Total Idiot. Dow Info.

I took Harvard's suggestion and called Dow direct. They said adhesives
that are latex based would work. I was given a small list of recommended
adhesive for their extruded polystyrene. Here it is: 1) PL 300 2) Dap
Beats The Nail Enviro Line - Made by DAP 3) Sonnoborn 200 4) QB 300 I
was told that most of these are available at home depot. Hopefully none
of them would cause problems when laminating with epoxy resin. I'm not
starting my project for several weeks, but I will post my results if
anyone is interested.

Casica Gore Tex Glass-In Vent Plug (Self-Venting)


The Casica design has the Gore Tex membrane bonded around the
circumference using a very specialized process. This vent is SELF-VENTING,
which means it "breathes" constantly alleviating the need to open and
close it. Or in worse case, forgetting to close it! The vent will flow
40 ml/minute max, and SUP's over 10' or hollow boards should use two
(mid-board & near tail). Originally, Gore designed this vent for sealed
military electronics, so it meets very stringent spec's for a saltwater
environment. This vent isn't an immunity to heat problem with EPS, and
customers should understand that boards still cannot be left in the sun;
especially upside down on roof racks.
