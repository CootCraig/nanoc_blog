will store and protect your gear no matter where your fishing adventure
takes you.



I just purchased Ready to Fish Soft Sided Tackle Bag the spec say it
fits 5 medium utility boxes. Do you guys carry these boxes?

most anything that is less than 15"x10" will fit standing on

is a good buy forâ€¦ see more Guttenaffe answered on July 8, 2013

Does it come with the clear plastic boxes that hold the lures? Or do I
have to buy them separate? If so, what size?

A: No it does not. You do have to buy separately. The compartment size
is 14"x8" with 7.5" height. I have 2-plano 3600 and 6-plano 3449 with
a small amount of space left for packages of soft baits.
