Bouteloua curtipendula, or Side-oats Grama, is a rarity among native
grasses in that it sports tiny attractive flowers during its summer bloom
time (see detailed photos.) Bracts hang uniformly from one side of the
stem while brilliant red-purple anthers dangle below and delicate white
stigmas protrude above. When the seed heads dry, they have a distinctly
oat-like appearance.

Side-oats is a warm-season grass that grows actively during the summer
months when soil temperatures are warm. Its current range is throughout
North America and south to Argentina, and it is cited as a food source
or larval host for at least five types of skipper moths. Bouteloua
curtipendulaâ€™s rhizomatous clumping tendency and moderate height make
it a good companion for spring-blooming wildflowers like Shooting Stars
or Prairie Smoke.

  Western Wheatgrass
</h4>

This species is generally a relatively low yielding forage producer, but
can be harvested and utilized as native hay, especially from overflow
sites that collect additional moisture.  Western wheatgrass is well
adapted to stabilization of disturbed soils because of its strong,
spreading rhizomes.  It is very compatible with slower developing native
grasses such as bluebunch wheatgrass, thickspike wheatgrass, strea mbank
wheatgrass and needlegrass species.

Hancock Seed Company
</h2>

Richard Hancock began custom seed harvesting in Florida in 1978.  As the
business has grown, additional facilities for seed processing, warehousing
and shipping were built on the family farm near Dade City.  Richard was
the originator of the "no till" wildlife food plot concept and introduced
the first no till products into the market in the 1990's.  Christopher
Hancock, the oldest son, has brought advanced website technology and
marketing strategies to the business since 2005.  With goals of being a
major exporter and dominant web retailer,  Hancock Farm & Seed Company
is expanding  personnel systems for harvesting, processing, shipping,
web management, sales and service.
