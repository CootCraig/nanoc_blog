Bouteloua curtipendula, or Side-oats Grama, is a rarity among native
grasses in that it sports tiny attractive flowers during its summer bloom
time (see detailed photos.) Bracts hang uniformly from one side of the
stem while brilliant red-purple anthers dangle below and delicate white
stigmas protrude above. When the seed heads dry, they have a distinctly
oat-like appearance.

Side-oats is a warm-season grass that grows actively during the summer
months when soil temperatures are warm. Its current range is throughout
North America and south to Argentina, and it is cited as a food source
or larval host for at least five types of skipper moths. Bouteloua
curtipendula’s rhizomatous clumping tendency and moderate height make
it a good companion for spring-blooming wildflowers like Shooting Stars
or Prairie Smoke.

  Western Wheatgrass
</h4>

This species is generally a relatively low yielding forage producer, but
can be harvested and utilized as native hay, especially from overflow
sites that collect additional moisture.  Western wheatgrass is well
adapted to stabilization of disturbed soils because of its strong,
spreading rhizomes.  It is very compatible with slower developing native
grasses such as bluebunch wheatgrass, thickspike wheatgrass, strea mbank
wheatgrass and needlegrass species.

Hancock Seed Company
</h2>

Richard Hancock began custom seed harvesting in Florida in 1978.  As the
business has grown, additional facilities for seed processing, warehousing
and shipping were built on the family farm near Dade City.  Richard was
the originator of the "no till" wildlife food plot concept and introduced
the first no till products into the market in the 1990's.  Christopher
Hancock, the oldest son, has brought advanced website technology and
marketing strategies to the business since 2005.  With goals of being a
major exporter and dominant web retailer,  Hancock Farm & Seed Company
is expanding  personnel systems for harvesting, processing, shipping,
web management, sales and service.

  All Nitrogen Fixers Are Not Created Equal
</h3>

While you may choose to grow non-native pears and peaches in your food
forest, there is no particular reason to grow a non-native nitrogen fixer
over a native one, with all things being equal. In fact I tend to assume
that native plants have a network of visible and invisible relationships
with other organisms of all kingdoms, making them more desirable to use
whenever possible. I think with the information these databases have
provided, we are in an excellent position to promote particular native
nitrogen fixers for use in permaculture projects.

<h2>COLORADO</h2>

Non-native trees - Medium Nitrogen - Elaeagnus angustifolia 	Robinia pseudoacacia

Native Shrubs - Medium Nitrogen - Alnus incana tenuifolia, Amorpha fruticosa, Ceanothus velutinus, Elaeagnus commutata, Shepherdia argentea, S. canadensis

Native Herbs - Medium Nitrogen - Amorpha canescens, Dalea formosa, Dryas octopetala, Hedysarum boreale

Native Vines - Medium Nitrogen - Apios americana

<h5>White Prairie Clover (Dalea candida)</h5> is a native clover of the
prairies that extends some into the Eastern Forest region. It is used to
make a tea, but had never crossed my mind as a particularly significantly
given at all of the hundreds of species that seemed to grow in the
prairie. Now I know that the USDA database states that this is the only
herb native to North America that fixes over 160 pounds of nitrogen per
acre per year. Though it wants full sun and (and can handle fairly dry
soils), I’m going to try to find room for some of this little–used
native that is deserving of a place in the spotlight. Interestingly,
like alder, members of this genus can be found in the high, medium and
low categories.

<h5>False Indigo (Amorpha fruticosa)</h5> is native to almost the
entire country, though it is considered invasive in Connecticut and a
noxious weed in Washington. It can be found from flooded riparian areas
to extremely dry conditions, though it always wants a good amount of
sun. Studies in the Southeast have shown that under their conditions
it can be coppiced up to four times a year for alley cropping chop and
drop, though permaculturist Jerome Osentowski reports that it does not
coppice well in the high desert of Colorado. It is very widely used in
China in agroforestry projects due to its fertility benefits and use
as a pesticide. I also personally like that it is neither suckering nor
thorny. USDA rates this as a “medium” nitrogen fixer.
