  The Bible Project
</h1>

The Bible Project is a non-profit animation studio that produces
short-form, fully animated videos to make the biblical story accessible
to everyone, everywhere. We create videos, podcasts, and study guides
that explore the Bible’s unified story.

The Bible is a divine-human book that speaks God’s word to his
people. We believe it ultimately points us to Jesus, who has the power
to change individuals and whole communities when we let the biblical
story speak for itself.

We focus on the Bible's overarching themes and each book’s literary
design and are committed to understanding the Bible in its historical
context.
