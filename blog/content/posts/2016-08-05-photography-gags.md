Did You Know!

Colorful Long Exposure Photos of Glow Sticks Dropped Into Waterfalls?

Photographers Sean Lenz and Kristoffer Abildgaard ‘From the Lens’,
have come up with a brilliant light painting concept that produces
gorgeous results. For their project titled ‘Neon Luminance,’ they
dropped glow sticks into waterfalls and then used long exposures to
capture the bright and colorful trails as the sticks were carried down
stream. The other features of the landscape were lit using road flares,
headlamps, and moonlight. If your wondering how the duo managed to
get such bright glows from their glow sticks, it’s because they used
high-powered ones manufactured by Cyalume (The sticks can be purchased
for about $1 each over on Amazon). After dropping the sticks into
various waterfalls in Northern California, they used exposures ranging
from 30 seconds to 7 minutes to capture the movement of the sticks. For
variations on the theme, they used different colored sticks and bundles
of sticks strung together.
