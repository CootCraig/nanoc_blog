  Frequently asked questions about the lectionary
</h2>

There are two distinct lectionaries that are provided through the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) Web site.

The two-year Daily Lectionary comes from the Presbyterian Book
of Common Worship (Westminster John Knox Press, 1993) where it was
adapted from the Episcopal Book of Common Prayer; it may also be found
in the Mission Yearbook for Prayer and Study, published each year
by the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). This lectionary is intended for
personal study and reflection, as well as daily prayer in individual
or small group settings. In a two-year period, this lectionary allows
users to read through the Old Testament once and the New Testament
twice, moving sequentially and systematically through large sections
of scripture. Two morning psalms and two evening psalms are provided
for each day, so that the readings may be framed by prayer, using the
words of the psalms. Users of this lectionary may choose to read all
the lessons in one sitting, or may distribute the readings throughout
the day as a part of the practice of daily prayer (a common pattern is
Old Testament in the morning, Epistle at noon, and Gospel in the evening).

The lectionary readings are listed in the Book of Common Worship, starting on page 1031.
