# Tasks

## Stepped Sine Wave Scarf model in OpenScad

### Generate 2D polygon DXF for one sine wave step`

From the User Manual we learn:

OpenSCAD provides two types of 3D modelling:

* Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG)
* extrusion of 2D primitives into 3D space.

Autocad DXF files are used as the data exchange format for 2D outlines. In
addition to 2D paths for extrusion it is also possible to read design
parameters from DXF files. Besides DXF files OpenSCAD can read and create
3D models in the STL and OFF file formats.

OpenSCAD, The Instructable

I am going to be writing more OpenSCAD Instructables. I want an
Instructable that I can refer to that explains the OpenSCAD concepts
you won’t find in the user manual. This is that Instructable.

I teach a class at Tampa Hackerspace called “OpenSCAD Introduction”,
this is based on that class.

## Use / Include Thread

### <a href="http://forum.openscad.org/Openscad-include-folder-file-scad-doesn-t-really-work-tp651p653.html" target="_blank">Giles Bathgate-2 post</a> Use / Include

As far as I understand "include", basically includes the text from one
file in another, as if you had just cut the contents from one file and
paste it in the other (or just concatenated the two files together)

"use" is much smarter only modules in the file are pulled into the other,
this doesn't include top level objects. also global variables within
the lib seem to get thier own namespace, and for good reason

### <a href="http://forum.openscad.org/Openscad-include-folder-file-scad-doesn-t-really-work-tp651p657.html" target="_blank">Bas PijlsBas post</a>

Bas Pijls:

I know that MATLAB has a funky way of dealing with global variables. I
circumvented the this once by implementing constants as functions. In
openscad you could put the following in an include file:

<pre>
 function height() =  1*cm;
 function length() = height()/2;
</pre>

Functions, as opposed to global variables, are included using the "use"
statement.

# Special Variables

<a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#Special_variables_2" target="_blank">OpenSCAD_User_Manual Special Variables</a>

## $fa, $fs and $fn

The $fa, $fs and $fn special variables control the number of facets used
to generate an arc:

$fa is the minimum angle for a fragment. Even a huge circle does not
have more fragments than 360 divided by this number. The default value
is 12 (i.e. 30 fragments for a full circle). The minimum allowed value
is 0.01. Any attempt to set a lower value will cause a warning.

$fs is the minimum size of a fragment. Because of this variable very
small circles have a smaller number of fragments than specified using
$fa. The default value is 2. The minimum allowed value is 0.01. Any
attempt to set a lower value will cause a warning.

$fn is usually 0. When this variable has a value greater than zero,
the other two variables are ignored and full circle is rendered using
this number of fragments. The default value is 0.

TIP: If you want to create a circle/cylinder/sphere which has a axis
aligned integer bounding box (i.e. a bounding box that has integral
dimensions, and an integral position) use a value of $fn that is divisible
by 4.

Attach library for Openscad by obijuan

Openscad library for easily attaching parts. This is an experimental
work on enhancing the openscad tool. Usually the code written by users
is difficult to read and understand. If we want to share the code and
to reuse parts made by others, it is very important to write clean code.

The attach operator is a experimental way of joining together parts. It
just hides all the translate/rotate operators to the user, making the
code easier to read, maitain and reuse.

I have written about it (and given an example of use) in this post:

The attach operator is part of the obiscad tools I am developing:

Vector library for OpenScad by obijuan

This is a Vector library for drawing vectors in Openscad. It is extremely
useful for designing robots and viewing their kinematics. In addition,
it gives a lot of help when designing parts by means of displaying
auxiliary vectors and frames of reference.

Another very useful operator is "orientate()" which make the child to
point in the direction given by a vector.

The vector library is part of the tools I am developing for making it
easier the use of Openscad. These tools are called obiscad. They are
located in this repo:
