2 Chronicles 20
</pre>

Are you an athiest? What is it you are denying?

<h4>2 Chronicles 20:5</h4>

And Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the
house of the LORD, before the new court, and said, “O LORD, God of our
fathers, are you not God in heaven? You rule over all the kingdoms of
the nations. In your hand are power and might, so that none is able to
withstand you. Did you not, our God, drive out the inhabitants of this
land before your people Israel, and give it forever to the descendants
of Abraham your friend? And they have lived in it and have built for
you in it a sanctuary for your name, saying, ‘If disaster comes upon
us, the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before
this house and before you for your name is in this house and cry out to
you in our affliction, and you will hear and save.’ And now behold,
the men of Ammon and Moab and  w Mount Seir, whom you would not
let Israel invade when they came from the land of Egypt,and whom they
avoided and did not destroy behold, they reward us by coming to drive
us out of your possession, which you have given us to inherit. our God,
will you not  a execute judgment on them? For we are powerless against
this great horde that is coming against us. We do not know what to do,
but our eyes are on you.”
...
Meanwhile all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their
wives, and their children. And the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jahaziel
the son of Zechariah, son of Benaiah, son of Jeiel, son of Mattaniah, a
Levite of the sons of Asaph, in the midst of the assembly. And he said,
“Listen, all Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem and King Jehoshaphat:
Thus says the LORD to you, ‘Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed
at this great horde, for the battle is not yours but God’s.
