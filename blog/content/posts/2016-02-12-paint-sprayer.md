#### Great for Woodworking By S. Hagertyon

I have had this unit for about a year and a half now. So far I have used
it exclusively for finishing my woodworking projects. I have sprayed
a wide variety of finishes including water based polyurethane, water
based dye, shellac, General Finishes Outdoor Oil, alcohol based dye,
nitrocellulose lacquer, Waterlox, and milk paint.

Please bear in mind that this is my first and only HVLP stsyem, but I
could not be happier with its performance. It is very easy to setup,
adjust, and clean. In addition to the 2.0mm that comes with the system,
I also purchased the 1.5mm and 1.0mm needle/nozzle sets. I find that I
use the 1.5mm most of the time. In fact, I have only used the included
2.0mm when spraying General Finishes Milk Paint which is quite thick,
while the 1.0mm was really only useful when spraying very thin 1/2lb
cut shellac. Therefore, based on my experience, I would highly suggest
buying the optional 1.5mm needle/nozzle set

Earlex HV5ACC15USR Fine Finish Needle

I also recommend that you do not use this or any spray system unless
you wear some sort of respirator! I have this model from 3M and it
works wonderfully:

3M R-7512ES Professional Half-Mask Organic Vapor, P95 Respirator Assembly,
Medium

I really have been pleased with my Earlex 5500. With it I can lay down
light even coats of finish; and by using proper technique (for which there
was a learning curve) I don't need to worry about drips & runs. Based the
wide variety of finishes I've used you should be able to get a good idea
of its versatility. Cleaning is always a concern with something like this,
and let me assure you that with the Earlex cleaning is very simple. Simply
empty any unused finish back into the original container, then rinse
out the pot using the appropriate solvent (be it water, mineral spirits,
alcohol, naptha, or lacquer thinner). Next add some of the solvent and
clamp the it back onto the gun. Attach the turbine and spray until the
solvent comes out clear. Now empty the put and rinse again. Take the gun
to a sink (or use could use a bucket of water) and disassemble the nozzle
and needle. Run the appropriot size brush up the pickup tube and through
opening where the nozzle attaches. Set the gun aside to dry. Finally,
I drop the nozzle, needle, and the pattern nozzle (I don't know what else
to call it) into a cup of solvent overnight, after which I take them out,
dry them off and pack everything away until the next time.

One last thing about Earlex is their customer service. I have called
on more than one occasion to ask advice about spraying something that I
had not done yet, such as the milk paint and the Outdoor Oil. Each time
they have been more than willing to help. I think that says a lot about
a company. I am very glad that I decided to buy the Earlex.

#### Marvin Earneston

Bought this spraying system primarily to spray water-based stains,
dyes and topcoats. Also purchased the 1.5 needle since the package on
Amazon included the 2.0 needle. Only took a few minutes to get up and
going. I've seen some concerns expressed about the plastic hose, but don't
think it'll be an issue for me---I'm a hobbyist, not making a living with
it. Only used it on one project so far, but am very pleased. I like the
teflon-coated cup--really makes cleanup easy. The gun seems to be of very
good quality. My first turbine purchase, I've been using guns that run
off of my compressor. Am now a convert to turbines. Water-based material
is a little trickier than oil or solvent based, but the learning curve
is fairly short. Found it easy to adjust the flow of material. Easy to
adjust fan pattern. I highly recommend this system for serious woodworking
hobbyists like myself. I think it packs pretty good bang for the buck.

#### Perfect for Beginners: Great Results!  By NenaLiuon

After watching the included CD and many you tube videos i decided to
buy this one.   It is the simpliest spray gun in the world.  Once you
see the final job you can see that those $300  were well spent.
There are other similar to this and cheaper, but that pro paint gun
got into my eyes! I have never use a spray gun before and i am amazed
of the final job i had. I painted my kitchen cabinets inside and out!!
Very little overspray!!!  I used Benjamin Moore's Advance primer; gloss
paint and a paint conditioner from the Home Depot (Wagner Easy Paint))
to help dilute the paint...much better that diluting with water. Use the
included viscocity cup...is of great help.  The manual that came with
it says 160 seconds for the viscocity time...but it must have to be 60
seconds. Once i figured out that, it was a breeze. Very eeeeeassssy to
use and to clean! Almost as loud as a vaccum cleaner. Let it run for
about two minutes for it to warm the air and GO! .....Next Project!!!

#### This spray system is amazing. I refinish kitchen cabinets professionally and this system ...  By Scott S.

This spray system is amazing. I refinish kitchen cabinets professionally
and this system with the 2.0 needle it comes with works great for spraying
PPG Breakthrough straight from the can. I then switch to a 1.5 needle
for spraying the polyurethane top coat. This kit has literally made me
tens of thousands of dollars

#### Great value By Keith J. Sibille

I am a weekend woodworker and I had always wanted to try spraying my
projects. I knew I needed an HVLP sprayer in order to spray latex paint
but I didn't want to spend a lot of money. I tried researching the web
and really couldn't make a decision so I purchased the Wagner system
with the stand alone turbine. I had built a chest of drawers and go set
up to paint. Thank goodness I had set up a temporary spray booth because
the overspray was massive and there was paint everywhere. It's possible
that I had a defective unit because the paint would continue to flow even
when the trigger was released. I brought it back and went back to the web.

I was watching a video of Jeff Devlin building a project and I noticed
that he was using this Earlex sprayer. After researching a bit, it seemed
like a good product, with a metal gun, not plastic like the Wagner and
mostly stainless steel.

This gun works as advertised. The overspray is very minimal and the
controls allow for a very controlled pattern. The gun atomizes the
paint very well and I was using latex thinned with a very small amount
of water. The finish turned out exceptionally good.

Cleanup was also a breeze. The paint cup is lined with Teflon so the
paint just rinses out. Run water through the gun, remove just a few parts
and rinse it out and it's clean and ready to go. After just a couple of
sessions, I am able to clean the gun and switch paint colors in about
5 minutes.

If you're looking for a spray gun that has professional qualities but
won't break the bank, I'd highly recommend the Earlex 5500.

<a href="http://lumberjocks.com/reviews/3259" target="_blank">lumberjocks review</a> Reivew of Earlex Spray Station HV5500 HVLP - Buy it now.

Buy it. If you don’t have a spray gun but have been thinking about
it, buy it. If you want to spray, but the cost is too high on those
fancy/expensive systems, buy it. If every project needs to have a perfect,
auto paint gloss finish, no matter how long it takes, then this is not
the product for you.

I have had mine for over a year now and it does exactly what it is
supposed to do. Sure, I could have spent more to get a finer mist, or
see through reservoir, or more bells and whistles, but this thing does
it’s job without complaint. I don’t like the center of balance on
the handle when loaded with paint, it is uncomfortable to hold after
a while. It is louder then I like. But I don’t know if spending more
money would fix either one of those problems enough to count. Bottom line
is a shop sprayer is there to save you time. Don’t confuse these with
an airbursh. You are not going to get those kinds of results. This is
a substitute for brushes and rollers. That said, this product saves me
time, I am pleased with the results, and I don’t know if any cheaper
product could make me as satisfied or a more expensive product do that
much of a better job to be worth it. When I put a fine finish on a frame
this is not the tool. For just about everything else, this is what I use.

Just remember to thin your paint or finish correctly and turn down the
volume until you get the spray you want. Just because it is a sprayer
does not mean you can do everything in one, 10 second coat. It still
takes time, just not nearly as much as a brush or roller.

CharlesNeil - Earlextech has it right, you can spray anything, you want
the 1.5 needle/nozzle for waterbase, ,shellacs and lacquers, and the
2.0 and I think they have a 2.5 for heavier paints, like latex

Earlextech - Hey guys, thanks for all the nice comments and suggestions,
believe me I make sure you are heard here at Earlex. This coming year we
will have new things coming out such as a 5 stage system and also pint
cups for the 5500/6900 guns that will be sold as two in a package with
one lid that connects to the gun and one with a lid to store material
in. There is also, right now, an after market cup that you can get
from 3M called the PPS system, it’s a pressureized cup with a bag in
it. Their #18 collar fits our gun and connects to their cup, it’s a
great system, it makes cleanup even easier and it give you the ability
to turn the gun upside down (should you need to) to spray.

As far as cleaning between coats, it’s totally unnescessary. I
spray latex at The Woodworking Shows for three days each week without
cleaning at all. Load the gun on Thursday during setup and clean it
on Sunday after breakdown. Never had a problem. There will always be a
dried booger of finish on the tip when you take even a 30 minute break
between coats. Scratch it off with your fingernail and go right back to
spraying. This happens with all guns.

Shelly B, The advantage to a turbine is that you’re not running a
compressor all day while spraying, you don’t have the contamination
issues that come with compressed air, you have 75% less overspray than
with a compressor and it’s a much more even coat than you can get by
brushing or wiping and one more thing you should know.

Nobody sprays a perfect coat. That’s not how it works. After you spray
the best coat possible, using all of your expertise and experience to
do the best job possible, that coat has to flow on the project, in other
words – move. It’s the flowing out of the finish that makes it smooth,
even and able to reflect light correctly so that it appears perfect.

Earlextech - Actually Mellie, we have a non-Teflon cup available for those
solvent based finishes. The Teflon coated cup is for waterborne/water
based materials. We don’t make liners for our cups but you can get
them from other manufacturers that will fit our cup.

Earlextech - I agree with GregD. “I think the only requirement for
successful spraying is to get a wet coat of finish at an appropriate
thickness. Drips obviously mean that the coat is too thick. Rough texture
suggest to me that the finish isn’t forming a wet layer – too much
air and too little finish.”

Orange peel is the result of the finish drying too fast and not having
enough time to level out.

I would thin less, maybe 10% or one viscosity cup of water into a quart
of paint. Then add two ounces of Floetrol.  Acrylic does not spray
as well as regular latex. Stir with a paddle mixer in a drill for one
minute. Medium speed.

About 6” away from project is probably right.

What is the project?


Luke - Listen to Earlex Tech… he knows. I have the 5500. I have sprayed
MANY paint products. Unfortunately I bought it to spray clear finishes
and 7 of 10 times I use it is with Latex Paint not what I wanted to do.

I’ve found that Latex with Primer mixed in is horrid to use.

Flotrol helps alot also, I picked that up from Jeff Jewitt’s finishing
book.

I’ve sprayed Behr, Valspar, Sherwin Williams, and Vista Paint (I think
they are just local). I did some bead-boarded wainscotting in my daughters
room and decided I didn’t want to mask the entire room off to spray,
so I brushed/rolled. That lasted about 30 min, and then I masked the
room off and sprayed.

Keep in mind, that to get a completely BUMP FREE surface from Paint, you
will need ALOT of force for atomization. Everyone of my paint projects
has a slight texture to it, but having rolled about 30 square feet of
primer on my daughters wainscotting, the spray texture is LESS noticeable
than the roll texture.

IF you want a glass like finish you’ll need a several step process of
priming/sanding/painting/sanding/buffing, and may also want to consider
spraying a tinted lacquer. General finishes sells WB tinted poly, that
is what cabinet makers often use.

Also using Acrylic enamel vs Vinyl enamel will make a difference I
believe. For me, I just have an understanding of REASONABLE expectations
with the 5500, its totally capable, but if your expecting a lacquer like
finish of a latex paint, I don’t think its going to happen. After all,
with the exception of milk paint, very few furniture/cabinetry is painted,
its lacquered. Its a harder surface.

Here is a project used with the Earlex, sprayed Clear Poly on finished
desk, Shellac as a sealer/primer, and Latex.

Click for details: Built in craft desk

A couple of thoughts, there have been numerous threads about this subject,
don’t examine your finished project from 6” away, no one looks at
it like that… Take a step back.

Here is what I do: Thin the paint – it depends on the manufacturer
(they’re all different) after a while you’ll know and won’t have
to use the viscosity cup. I’d recommend Jeff Jewitt’s spray finishing
book also. You may have to thin more than you think.

Try flotrol, it helps the paint stay wet, and level better.

I use the 1.5mm needle usually when spraying latex, I’ve had better
luck with that one.



Luke - The day the previous post came out I had finished my fourth big job
with this Earlex. My wife bought it for me for fathers day a few years
ago, I got the kit that came with the extra needle (1.5mm). Before this
I used a $14 HF HVLP sprayer with a very small compressor, I had to wait
in between sprays for the compressor to cycle. I’ve sprayed Shellac,
WB Poly, Latex, NGR Dye and a few other things with this sprayer. I
just completed wainscoting in my daughters room and sprayed it with
the 5500. I sprayed my neighbors entertainment center, mine as well, I
build a desk in our loft that is 16 feet long, sprayed the latex paint,
as well as shellac and WB poly for the desk top.

I’m not a professional, strictly a hobbyest, and home fixer-upper.

I gotta say, the Earlex is amazing. I’ve had my shares of frustration
with it, but in the end, if I look on the web, or read some tips, the
issues can almost always be resolved.

When spraying clear finishes, Shellac, Poly, Lacquer etc, this thing is
a champ! I love it. When spraying my 16×2.5’ desk top, I couldn’t
imagine finishing it any other way. I am the type that HATES the finishing
process, its usually when I run into the most issues. Some complain that
spraying takes too much time to mask off, I’d rather mask than brush
any day.

As far as the performance, I’ve had it for 3 years this June (2013)
I’ve sprayed Sherwin Williams, Vista, and Behr, General finishes,
Minwax and Zinseer, and I think this thing is worth its weight in gold!

The Pros: Easy to use, plug it in, make sure the filter is clean,
turn it on, fill it up, dial the amount of material, and spray away,
its that easy. Accompanied with a good spray book or DVD this thing will
open your eyes.

Clean up is usually a straight forward process, and doesn’t take
much time.

Portability, pick it up and use it where you need it.

The Cons: In a previous review, one had mentioned the handle is a bit
small, I agree, but I do find I get more fatigue holding a brush then
then holding the sprayer.

I’ve read in several reviews that people have complained of the teflon
coating coming off inside the cup, I have that problem inside of my cup,
after the first time I sprayed Shellac it started to come off.

The plastic clip that holds the hose on the handle shortly broke after
purchase so the hose storage is a bit cumbersome.

Honestly thats really it for cons. If the cup didn’t chip, I’d’ve
given it 5 stars.

I do have some thoughts, I wouldn’t call them “CONS” I’m not
a fan of the intake being at the bottom of the unit, usually there is
plastic where I spray and on more than one occasion, its sucked plastic
and I’ve had to rush to turn off the unit. Also I do try to keep my
spray area clean, but dust in the air and the like settles on the floor,
so sucking air in from the floor seems a bit illogical to me, I’m sure
there was a reason for it…

It would be nicer to have the hose just be able to be stored in the
unit instead of having the top 2’ of hose clipped, being that the
clip is plastic, that creates a hassle, and I usually just store the
hose separate now.

The hose pops out if you don’t really put it in the spray gun, I don’t
call that a con, because it happening two times to me before I realized
I just needed to use more pressure to keep the hose in isn’t a big deal.

All in all, no one product is perfect, but I will say that this thing
is worth the money. One tip that I can say yielded great results in
spraying Latex was to do what Earlex Tech said, buy a paint mixer drill
bit, I did notice that the paint would spray much easier. My dad had
some wainscoting done that was sprayed by a pro with an airless system,
and I think mine is smoother to the touch than his, not saying that its
a better product, but it can yield GREAT RESULTS.
