### <a href="http://www.sliversmill.com/index.html" target="_blank">slivers mill home page</a>

Slivers Mill, a Forrest Saw Blades distributor, aims to be the one-stop
shop for all of your saw blade needs. WE ARE THE LARGEST STOCKING
DISTRIBUTOR OF FORREST SAW BLADES AND WILL SHIP MOST ITEMS WITHIN 24
HOURS. We offer virtually all Forrest blades. Why? Because the quality
and craftsmanship of Forrest Saw Blades are second to none.

Forrest blades offer a superior cut that leaves a rip-cut saw edge as
smooth as if it had been sanded, and a cross-cut edge that is almost
mark-free. The blades run very quietly, and backside tearout in plywood
is negligible.

Each blade is virtually hand-made. The plate is hand-tensioned (up to 15
minutes per blade), superior C-4 carbide teeth are hand-brazed to the
plate, and the blade is straightened and restraightened multiple times
throughout the process.

Think of a Forest blade as a tool in your shop, not an accessory. It's
been proven time and again. You'll save money in the long run by using
high quality Forrest saw blades.

##### I use these all the time...

WB Halper TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on February 17, 2015

This is perfect when a square block of steel is needed. I use them as
calibration standards for my woodworking tools. They're not good enough
for high precision metal work, but they're perfect to calibrate the scale
on my miter saw fence...when I stack two blocks between the saw blade and
the stop and the scale is adjusted to 6", I know that the rest of the
scale is also dead on. I'm also using four of these, bolted to the saw
bed, to hold the miter saw fence exactly vertical and at right angles
to the blade path. (BTW, if you look at the picture, the fence pieces
are normally much closer together...barely enough to clear the saw blade.)

Want to see if your cheap calipers are reading right? Grab one of these
and measure it. At 0.0002" accuracy, they're far more accurate than any
inexpensive measuring tool.

These are cheap and they work. Keep them corrosion free, don't drop them
and they'll last forever.


##### Excellent vallue, great functionality

By W. R. Davis on October 7, 2009

I have a Lee Valley router system that uses a steel top and fence with no
calibrated scales or adjustments. I finally understood that this fence
was designed more from a machinist's rather than woodworker's point
of view. I purchased some small brass setup blocks and got immediate
benefit in repeatable, quick setups. I realized that the larger 1-2-3
blocks should add even more flexibility and I discovered this low cost
set of blocks. As soon as I used them, I understood their value. They
are well made and for a home user, I see no reason to even consider a
more expensive set. I am going to buy one or two sets more. Actually
this will make great low cost gifts for my family to give me for
Christmas. I've used these for more than the router table. They work
well on the workbench, the table saw, and the drill press.

great for what it is By Lungchin on Apr 17, 2015

look - this is not a drill press - and its 30+ bucks -

and yes - tolerances of the slides are not exactly super tight - and the
bushing of the chuck probably will wear out if used a lot - and handle of
mine broke off when i tried to shift it a bit while i had it positioned
with a middli torqued clamp

BUT - i had to drill 5/8 holes for bolting 4x4s together in place for a
play structure - there is NO way this would have worked out freehand -
this things was great - clamp it in place - drill ... and holes aligned
great, were level - and bolt fit through perfectly

make sure you add a few drops of lubricant on bushing - teflon bike
chain lube or similar works perfectly
