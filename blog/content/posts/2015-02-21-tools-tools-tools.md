##### I use these all the time...

WB Halper TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on February 17, 2015

This is perfect when a square block of steel is needed. I use them as
calibration standards for my woodworking tools. They're not good enough
for high precision metal work, but they're perfect to calibrate the scale
on my miter saw fence...when I stack two blocks between the saw blade and
the stop and the scale is adjusted to 6", I know that the rest of the
scale is also dead on. I'm also using four of these, bolted to the saw
bed, to hold the miter saw fence exactly vertical and at right angles
to the blade path. (BTW, if you look at the picture, the fence pieces
are normally much closer together...barely enough to clear the saw blade.)

Want to see if your cheap calipers are reading right? Grab one of these
and measure it. At 0.0002" accuracy, they're far more accurate than any
inexpensive measuring tool.

These are cheap and they work. Keep them corrosion free, don't drop them
and they'll last forever.


##### Excellent vallue, great functionality

By W. R. Davis on October 7, 2009

I have a Lee Valley router system that uses a steel top and fence with no
calibrated scales or adjustments. I finally understood that this fence
was designed more from a machinist's rather than woodworker's point
of view. I purchased some small brass setup blocks and got immediate
benefit in repeatable, quick setups. I realized that the larger 1-2-3
blocks should add even more flexibility and I discovered this low cost
set of blocks. As soon as I used them, I understood their value. They
are well made and for a home user, I see no reason to even consider a
more expensive set. I am going to buy one or two sets more. Actually
this will make great low cost gifts for my family to give me for
Christmas. I've used these for more than the router table. They work
well on the workbench, the table saw, and the drill press.
