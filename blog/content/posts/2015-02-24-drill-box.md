# Motivation

Frustration with inability to drill holes
is so many things with
a bench top drill press.

The inspiration is a 
bench top drill press
mounted to the top of
a 4 sided box
with no front or back.

What is needed
is a flexible way
to secure
work pieces below
the drill spindle.

Let us start with
making a drill box
with a grid of holes
on all 4 sides.

We can now start
building fixtures
to secure work pieces
that are anchored
to the drill box
anchor holes.

His desk assembly could be used
as a work piece holder.
