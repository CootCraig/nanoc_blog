Lise Slape Wilson - on FB Zeroing in on Health - I usually salt mine
a little bit, then put in the oven at 425 turning once until it is
crispy. It takes about 45 minutes to get mine the way I like it. Much
less mess than frying. That is when I get the sliced kind. However,
When I get a slab of pork belly I salt it slightly then roast it. I put
in on a rack in a pan, then low oven for a bit (350 about 1.5 hours),
then high (500 for 10 mins or so) to crisp the fat. It is AWESOME. I
got the method off the internet somewhere. I don't use all the spices
they suggested, just the cooking method. You want to make sure the pork
belly is dry to get a pretty crispy skin.
