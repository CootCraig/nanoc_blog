  Use Cover Crops to Improve Soil By Barbara Pleasant October/November 2009
</h4>

There are three main ways to improve soil: grow cover crops, mulch the
surface with biodegradable mulches, and/or dig in organic soil amendments
(such as compost, grass clippings, rotted manure or wood chips). All have
their advantages and none should be discounted, but cover cropping is the
method least likely to be practiced in home gardens. There is a reason
for this: Information on using cover crops is tailored to the needs of
farmers who use tractors to make short work of mowing down or turning
under cover crops. But when your main tools for taking down plants have
wooden handles and you measure your space in feet rather than acres,
you need a special set of cover crop plants, and special methods for
using them.

BUCKWHEAT
SCIENTIFIC NAME: FAGOPYRUM ESCULENTUM
ABOUT
Buckwheat seed is widely grown as a grain forage crop, bee pasture, and soil improving cover crop. It is a warm season grain with a rapid and dense growth. Often used in rotation with vegetables.

Buckwheat is often grown to attract beneficial insects and as pasture for honey bees.

PLANTING INSTRUCTIONS:
Seeding rate:

50-60 lb./acre drilled
96 lbs/acre  broadcast

  PBSI Fall/Winter Cover Crop Mix
</h4>
Fall/Winter Cover Crop Mix is planted after a crop is harvested and
before the next crop is ready to be planted. Each seasonal mix contains
an optimal species combination, specially tailored to the season of
planting. This mix has cool season plants. The crop protects the soil from
wind and water erosion. It can also cut fertilizer costs by contributing
nitrogen to the soil, enhance soil health by adding biomass and moisture,
and improve yields.

Ingredients: Winter Peas, Winter Rye/Triticale, Turnips, Hairy Vetch, Radish, & Dwarf Essex Rape

  Winter Triticale - $0.35 /lb
</h4>

Winter Triticale is a winter annual grain developed through a cross
between winter wheat and winter rye. It is commonly planted for forage
production and displays desirable traits from each of its parent
species. Winter Triticale is extremely winter hardy like cereal rye but
produces high quality forage much like winter wheat. It is a mid-maturity
winter annual in comparison with rye and forage winter wheat. Winter
Triticale can be used in northern climates that experience harsh winter
conditions with little risk of winter kill. Winter Triticale is very
drought tolerant and is suitable for dryland conditions and lighter
soils. It will perform best on well drained to moderately drained soils
as extended periods of standing water can result in winter kill. Winter
Triticale is moderately tolerant to saline soils.
