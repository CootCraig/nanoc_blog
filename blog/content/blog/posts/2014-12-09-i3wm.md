## Notes

### Named Workspaces

#### 6.5.2. Renaming workspaces

You can rename workspaces. This might be useful to start with the default
numbered workspaces, do your work, and rename the workspaces afterwards
to reflect whatâ€™s actually on them. You can also omit the old name
to rename the currently focused workspace. This is handy if you want to
use the rename command with i3-input.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
i3-msg 'rename workspace to "2: irc"'

bindsym $mod+n exec i3-input -F 'rename workspace to "%s"' -P 'New name: '
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reading 6.5.1. Named workspaces in the User's Guide.  I don't understand
how to do a rename command.
