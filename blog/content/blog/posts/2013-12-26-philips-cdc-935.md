#### Hagerman Piccolo MC Headamp

[Piccolo MC Headamp](http://www.hagtech.com/piccolo.html)

$149 box 1/2 kit

The Piccolo is an active moving coil pre-preamplifier designed to step-up
the cartridge signal from MC to MM levels. Adjustable loading and gain
offers optimization for any MC cartridge. The discrete JFET circuit
offers super-quiet and distortion-free operation. Compatible with any
MM phonostage.

Power is provided by either 4 internal AA batteries or a 120Vac
external supply. The circuit employs super low-noise matched JFETs in a
differential configuration, but tapping only the non-inverting leg for
the output buffer, which can drive long cable runs. Careful attention
to layout and wiring eliminate ground loop problems.

The Piccolo is offered as a "box/2", which is not a full kit, but includes
a blank PCB with the JFETs already soldered in place, the metal blue
case (silkscreened), and a few assorted hardware pieces. Basically,
it is a half-kit plus box. This makes assembly very easy for DIYers.
