A friend is selling his 2002 Chevrolet 1500 extended cab 4x4.
It's in great condition and I would like to use it with a
slide in camper eventually.  It comes with a matching truck
cap that will get me started using it for off-pavement camping.

My desired uses are.

Mild weather (above freezing) on public land off-pavement roads.

Winter camping near ski areas. 
* Desire good insulation and furnace.
* Prefer portable drinking water and grey water containers over
  winterized tanks.

Stealth camping in urban setting to visit family and friends.
* My thinking is hard sides and no obvious indicators of people
  inside will minimize hassles.

Given the short bed and the relatively low weight capacity of
the Chevy 1500 my thought is one of these models: Importer,
Acapulco or Bayou.

Looking over this forum, I think the plans can adapted to fit
this truck and my intended uses.  I will do some looking at used
campers to look for one that has suitable price/condition/features
for me.

I welcome comments from the forum.

Thanks,
Craig
