After cobbling together untold numbers of small power supplies for
"auxiliary" functions in tube preamps and power amps, I decided to
design something with a regulator that is better than the ubiquitous
7800 series three terminal regulator and try it in places where it
powers something more than relay coils.  In locations like low voltage
negative supplies and as power for a USB to SPDIF digital audio converter
I found this supply sonically superior to my previous slapdash efforts.
This power supply uses the LT3080 regulator, which is adjustable by
changing one resistor for output voltages between 1 and 24 volts DC in
this implementation.  A charging slope lowering resistor and Schottky
rectifier diodes are provided to be kind to the power transformer and
reduce both supply noise and radiated magnetic field noise.  Along with
plenty of output bypass capacitance, this compact package does a thorough
job of supplying up to 4 watts of power at low voltages.  Resistors are
provided for 5, 6.3, 8, and 12VDC.  You can obtain other 0.25w resistors
for other voltages.  The supply can accommodate both 115V and 230V mains
voltage and has an on-board fuse holder for safety.  With the standard
supplied 8+8 volt secondary power transformer, the maximum possible DC
current draws are approximately:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>	5VDC          870mA </li>
  <li>	6.3VDC       700mA </li>
  <li>	8VDC          550mA </li>
  <li>	12VDC        470mA</li>
</ul>

<p>The PC board is 2.75" (7cm) x 3.3" (8.4cm) and the height is 1.6" (4cm).</p>
