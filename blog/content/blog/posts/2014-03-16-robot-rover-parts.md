The qik 2s9v1 is Pololuâ€™s second-generation dual serial motor
controller. The compact module allows any microcontroller or computer with
a serial port (external RS-232 level converter required) or USB-to-serial
adapter to easily drive two small, brushed DC motors with full direction
and speed control. It provides ultrasonic, 8-bit PWM speed control via
an advanced, two-way serial protocol that features automatic baud rate
detection up to 38.4 kbps and optional CRC error checking. Two status
LEDs give visual feedback about the serial connection and any encountered
error conditions, making debugging easy, and a demo mode allows easy
verification of proper operation.

This small, inexpensive motor controller allows variable speed and
direction control of two small, brushed DC motors using a simple serial
interface, making it easy to add motors to your microcontroller- or
computer-based project. The motor supply voltage range is 4.5 to 13.5
V; the continuous current per channel is up to 1 A (3 A peak). The
logic supply can be as low as 2.7 V, allowing operation with modern
microcontrollers running at 3.3 V.

Note that you can replace the motor in this kit with a lower-current,
higher-voltage motor if you want to use this gearbox with controllers
such as the qik 2s9v1 dual serial motor controller,
