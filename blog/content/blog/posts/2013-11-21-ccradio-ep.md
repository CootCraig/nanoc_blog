# CCRadio-EP AM/FM Portable - A Bob Grove What’s New Review
	
Larry Van Horn, New Products Editor

While it may seem strange that we would
be reviewing anything as plebian as an AM/FM
portable radio, there is a method to our madness.
For several years, GE offered their “Superadio”
to the consumer market; it had good sound, sharp
AM selectivity, and external antenna connections.
The radio sold in the $50-$60 range, and was
very popular with domestic AM broadcast DX-
ers. When it was discontinued, we had a surge of
inquiries for a replacement, but none was to be
found. Will the new CCRadio-EP be the answer?
	
The radio has decent sound, good AM selec-
tivity, wide/narrow FM selectivity, and external
antenna connectors. It has the traditional, analog,
slide-rule tuning dial which may be backlit for
night viewing.
	
Its 4-inch, self-contained speaker delivers
room-filling sound with notable bass and clean
highs with minimal distortion. Separate bass and
treble controls invite custom high/low roll-offs to
suit the listener’s preference. If you have a set of
stereo headphones, a stereo output jack provides
that listening mode as well. There is also a line-in
jack in case you have a personal MP3 or other
player that you’d like to hear through a larger
speaker.
	
The radio runs on either four D cells (not
included) or a 120 VAC/6 VDC wall adapter
(included). A snap-up/snap-down carrying handle
facilitates transport.
	
The CCRadio-EP is simple to operate and
should appeal to techie types with its unique
“Twin Coil Ferrite” AM fine tuning knob. This is
an RF peaking adjustment for the antenna input,
depending on the frequency being received. It
works with both the internal and external antenna.
	
It appears that the choice of external an-
tenna is rather critical, and experimenting with
optimum length and placement may be necessary
to avoid “swamping” that tuning circuit, as well
as avoiding common mode (ground loop) hum. I
suspect that a shorter outdoor wire antenna would
be better than a long one.
	
The internal ferrite loop antenna remains
in service with the external antenna attached. If
you were experiencing electrical noise interfer-
ence, it will still be there, hopefully attenuated
somewhat by stronger signal strengths brought
in by the outdoor wire. It is advisable to attach a
ground wire to that respective terminal as well to
avoid AC hum and other electrical line noise. If
such interference persists, battery operation and/
or relocation of the radio are recommended.
	
An FM internal/external switch allows
selection of an outdoor antenna via a TV-style F
connector. The benefits and disadvantages of high
sensitivity become immediately apparent when
switching between antennas. With the radio’s
telescoping whip, distances of up to 100 miles
are readily received at my location; switching to
an external beam, strong signal overload clouds
reception of weaker signals.
	
The AM wide/narrow IF filter selection
is appropriately labeled “Music” and”Voice.”
The wide bandpass allows more highs for in-
creased music fidelity, while the low bandpass
restricts the bandwidth to reject the frequencies
not required for speech reception. Additionally,
the independent bass and treble controls have a
profound effect on emphasizing or attenuating
the high and low audio frequencies.
	
The accuracy of the printed frequency dial
on our particular sample was excellent for FM,
but rather arbitrary for AM. Of course with any
analog-dial AM/FM radio, you tune for best
reception, not for what the print on the dial says.
	
The CCrane Radio-EP has good sensitivity
and the 4-inch speaker delivers credible sound,
enhanced by the separate treble and bass controls.
Its AM selectivity switch is very effective for
reducing adjacent channel interference. FM sen-
sitivity is excellent, providing distant reception
through its telescoping antenna.
	
With so many off-the-shelf AM/FM radios
now readily available from chain stores and at
widely disparate prices, it’s hard to compare them
fairly. Taking the radio at its face value – an AM/
FM portable with good sound and sensitivity – the
CCrane Radio-EP does its job well.
