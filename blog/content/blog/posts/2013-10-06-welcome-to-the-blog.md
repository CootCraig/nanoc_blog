Got to Blog at all?
-------------------

Sure, why not.

Move to Bluehost
----------------
I did a survey of shared hosting companies
and Bluehost had plenty of happy users.
Considerations:

+ Reasonable price
+ Large and well established
+ ssh

Blog Engine is Nanoc
--------------------

+ Static site generator, I have control of contents
+ Edit local, rsync to Bluehost to publish, Archive at Github
+ Choice of content format. Markdown, haml, html, ...
+ Ruby based
