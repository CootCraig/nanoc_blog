## Simple Push-Pull (SPP) Board

Why have I done “yet another version of this common design?” I have
breadboarded countless variations of small P-P amps. Some used the 6AQ5
tube, and some used the 6BQ5 / EL84 tube. Every amp was evaluated for
performance, simplicity, and most important, the ability to be assembled
by builders of varying skill levels and work the first time. One of
the main requirements was for a stable design that didn’t require
any component tweaking to make it work. This design worked out to be
the best. I chose the 6BQ5 / EL84 tube mostly because that is what was
requested in the email that I received. The 6AQ5 is cheaper but produces
slightly less power, and a slightly different sound. I may produce a
6AQ5 version of this board if there are enough requests for it.

As usual the board can be wired for triode, UL and pentode mode. Provision
for global negative feedback is available. It can be used if needed,
and it is needed in pentode mode.
