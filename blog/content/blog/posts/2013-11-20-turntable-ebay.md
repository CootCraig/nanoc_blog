## Listing Details

Up for sale, is an excellent condition, one owner, automatic Technics
SL 1600 Direct Drive System Turntable, with very low hours, that I've
purchased when it was brand new.

No cracks, or chips anywhere on dust cover, or on the TT, hinges work
as new, nice and snug.

Tone arm starts and returns to the correct point of record every time,
and all functions work perfectly, as they should.

a heavy and sturdy turntable, has superior accuracy, warm clean sound,

### 251362297565  VINTAGE-TECHNICS-SL-1600-MARK-2-QUARTZ-DIRECT-DRIVE-AUTOMATIC-TURNTABLE

Up for sale this week is this RARE vintage Technics SL 1600 Mark 2 Quartz
Direct drive automatic turntable.  It comes with an original V15 type
III Super Track Plus Sure Cartridge.

Faint, barely visible scuffs on the dust cover. The base of the turntable
is scuff free and very clean.

The turntable works, I have used it to play my vinyls but the queue
button, the pop-up light and the start stop button does not work
either. The green quartz lock light does not come on but keeps perfect
RPM.

I almost bought another 1200 awhile back but went for the 1600 MK2

...Don't get me wrong, I love the 1200---it's a 'fun' table---but the 1600
MK2 is a 'different animal' or flavor in the best way possible. The 1600
MK2 to me sonically represents why I thoroughly enjoy playing records;
The music sounds very much alive on one of these decks!

It's a turntable and an investment you will not regret---but, if you
opt not to go with the 1600 MK2, keep your eye open for these solidly
built,reliable models that are just a few steps beneath the hierarchy
of the 1600 MK2 and the 1200 MK2-----Technics SL Q2, SL Q3, SL Q202,
SL Q 303.---I own two of these models and am very happy with them and
ZERO mechanical or electronic issues with them.None whatsoever, and they
are circa 1980-81.

## Information on the Technics SL-Q2 and SL-Q3


[Audio Asylum - Technics SL Q2 and Q3....](http://www.audioasylum.com/audio/vinyl/messages/81/811698.html)


Technics SL Q2(Quartz speed accurate,heavy,well damped die-cast metal
plinth)---Simple,reliable,easy to use, semi-auto return(manual start u

A couple of SL Q3's (Full auto, Quartz speed accuracy,memo-repeat, can
be used as a semi-manual by cueing tonearm yourself instead of letting
autofunction take over)...

Q2 is semi-auto (arm returns at end of play), BUT you can still use as
partial manual since you have to cue it up yourself...The SL Q3 is the
one I have (I have two of them)...I know you said full manual.However,
again, you can maually cue up the tonearm if you want, overriding the
auto-start... Very solid and underrated decks from Technics...They do
have some of the 1200 heritage in them---The motor may not be as torquey
as the 1200's but same direct drive AND Quartz speed accurate design...
My Q3's are from 1979 and they still are FULLY operational in 2009(30
year old 'tables !)---NEVER has the full auto mechanism posed a problem
or breakdown...The die-cast metal plinth itself is heavy (not as heavy
as the 1200's) and very well damped from unwanted vibrations...It's
practically a plug n' play........The Q2 is also a VERY simple and
straightforward deck to use.For EASY and extremely low maintenance,
I add 1 or 2 drops of spindle bearing oil every year or couple of years.

What the Q2/Q3 lack are pitch control(cannot override or play with the
quartz accurate function)and no adjustable tonearm VTA height adjustment
as on the 1200 MK2.---So, if you are looking for those features, these
Technics don't have them.

The Q2/3 are very reliable and economical solid turntables.---Super
smooth damped cueing as well.Soundwise,they are also clean sounding
decks(clean presentable bass,mids,highs,decent detail).I have also NEVER
modded,tweaked,repaired, or have done anything to these fine underrated
decks---Again, I do stress their great and super dependable reliability
factor from my experience of owning them for years;They are no-nonsense
decks that perform admirably...

The Q2 and Q3 are like the 'younger' or smaller siblings of the 1200
MK2 and 1600 MK2 (bear a closer resemblance to the 1600 MK2)...

[Audio Asylum - Welcome to the VA!....Whatever you do,DO NOT...](http://db.audioasylum.com/mhtml/m.html?forum=vinyl&n=872837&highlight=sl+q2&r=&search_url=%2Fcgi%2Fsearch.mpl%3Fforum%3Dvinyl%26searchtext%3Dsl%2Bq2)

...get rid of that Technics SL Q2----I have two Q3's that have a few more
automated features than the Q2...Both the Q2 and Q3 are VERY reliable
and sharp looking decks as I'm sure you know already.I'm a fan of those
'tables.My SL Q3's have been performing flawlessy since 1979-(30 years
and going strong).I just apply a drop or two of spindle bearing oil once
a year.According to the Vintage Technics site, the Q2 was $200 with the
Q3 at $240(MSRP prices).

I hardly ever see a good 70's TT anymore in the thrifts. Online there
is less supply and the prices have gone up. Sellers want 200 euro for a
Thorens TD160 with the heavy arm. There are still vintage TT's flying
under the radar so to speak, Akai AP 206/207, Philips 800 series,
Pioneer Pl-12D, Technics SQ DD, Dual 500 series.


### Sympathy for the Bottom Feeder - a new FAQ?


Posted by plantsman (A) on September 5, 2006 at 05:12:57

I've been trying to help a poster on the Record Collectors Guild Forum
who is trying to get into vinyl for dirt cheap. My thought is that there
are probably quite a number of people out there for whom the $400+ for
a decent new turntable is really a huge amount of money. Maybe we ought
to combine our expertise to put together a buyers guide to inexpensive
used turntables: which ones are worth looking for and which ones to avoid
plus notes on how to check for serious problems. I'm talking about tables
that someone has a realistic chance of finding used in good condition
for less than $200, ideally less than $100. There probably should be a
parallel FAQ about cheap cartridges.

My nomination: the Denon DP-30L II - this is a competitor for the Technics
SL-1200 series but it has a lower mass arm (dynamically balanced/no servo)
better suited to high compliance moving magnet or moving iron cartridges.

I'll let the Thorens, Technics and Dual experts fill in their nominations
in those lines. JVC? Pioneer? Kenwood? Yamaha?

I would avoid the Philips GA-212/312 series - in my experience the arm
"bearings" (I think they may actually be delrin bushings) don't age
very gracefully.  IMO No P-Mounts!

### RE: Best Choice for Used Table $200

In Reply to: Best Choice for Used Table $200 posted by DrD on July 22, 2011 at 16:45:25:

All used direct drive turntables mostly under $200 with integrated
tonearm. Some might cost a little more but if you play your card right,
you can still get them in the $200 range. In that range, I usually look
for ones with a coreless motor for my personal sonic taste.
