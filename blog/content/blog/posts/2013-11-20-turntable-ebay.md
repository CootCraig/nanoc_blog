## Listing Details

### 281182870809

Up for sale, is an excellent condition, one owner, automatic Technics
SL 1600 Direct Drive System Turntable, with very low hours, that I've
purchased when it was brand new.

It is nearly pristine cosmetically. Dust cover has couple scratches
(see pictures).

No cracks, or chips anywhere on dust cover, or on the TT, hinges work
as new, nice and snug.

Tone arm starts and returns to the correct point of record every time,
and all functions work perfectly, as they should.

Turntable comes with Audio Tech. Stereo Cartridge AT96E

This SL 1600 has audiophile level performance, sounds amazing, it is
a heavy and sturdy turntable, has superior accuracy, warm clean sound,
and all in perfect working condition.

### 251362297565  VINTAGE-TECHNICS-SL-1600-MARK-2-QUARTZ-DIRECT-DRIVE-AUTOMATIC-TURNTABLE

Up for sale this week is this RARE vintage Technics SL 1600 Mark 2 Quartz
Direct drive automatic turntable.  It comes with an original V15 type
III Super Track Plus Sure Cartridge.

Faint, barely visible scuffs on the dust cover. The base of the turntable
is scuff free and very clean.

The turntable works, I have used it to play my vinyls but the queue
button, the pop-up light and the start stop button does not work
either. The green quartz lock light does not come on but keeps perfect
RPM.

I almost bought another 1200 awhile back but went for the 1600 MK2

...Don't get me wrong, I love the 1200---it's a 'fun' table---but the 1600
MK2 is a 'different animal' or flavor in the best way possible. The 1600
MK2 to me sonically represents why I thoroughly enjoy playing records;
The music sounds very much alive on one of these decks!

It's a turntable and an investment you will not regret---but, if you
opt not to go with the 1600 MK2, keep your eye open for these solidly
built,reliable models that are just a few steps beneath the hierarchy
of the 1600 MK2 and the 1200 MK2-----Technics SL Q2, SL Q3, SL Q202,
SL Q 303.---I own two of these models and am very happy with them and
ZERO mechanical or electronic issues with them.None whatsoever, and they
are circa 1980-81.
