02Ody02, as far as we've been able to tell on this forum via reading a
lot of Honda's TSB's, you're on-the-money.
</p>

<p>
As far as we could tell (it was a group effort), any 2004 Odyssey with
VIN 5FNRL18xx4B051621 and higher have all of the updates, and don't have
that external oil jet (nor require it).
</p>

<p>
That's all that our sleuthing could figure out.

odyclub thread -
2002 Ody with vin5FNRL18952 is this covered under the 04-021 recall?
<a href="http://www.odyclub.com/forums/24-1999-2004-odyssey/166569-2002-ody-vin5fnrl18952is-covered-under-04-021-recall.html#post817617" target="_blank">Odyfamily post</a>
</h5>

<p>
See this link: Oil Jet Recall. All 2002-2003 Odys are affected, and all
2004 Odys from the first one of that model year (VIN 5FNRL18..4B000001)
up to VIN 5FNRL18..4B051620 are included.
</p>

<p>
In short, your 2002 should have had this done already. You can tell
by checking the ATF fill plug on top of the A/T. If it is still there,
this 2nd gear oil jet recall has not been performed!
</p>

<p>
This just made me think. That last 2004 VIN must certainly be the last
of the standard BYBA Gen 2 5-speed trannies, i.e., A/T's with possible
3rd gear problems. Honda was called to task by the NHTSA in November
2003 to perform engineering changes, and somebody mentioned a while
ago that this not only included fixing the major sources of restricted
ATF flow to the third clutch pack, but also making changes to allow for
adequate ATF flow to the 2nd gearset. That means any 2004 Odyssey with VIN
5FNRL18..4B051621 and beyond has a "good" A/T. I'm guessing that these
later 2004 Odysseys will have an ATF fill plug on top of the A/T, since
there is no need for the 2nd gear oil jet kit on those later 2004 vans.

Thread - Transmission Fluid Change

<p>
Well, you are securing a threaded bolt into an aluminum bore...a good
torque wrench is the way to go. I've only purchased one "bargain" wrench,
and on that note, never again. I was actually installing a spark plug,
and said to myself, "Self, this feels like too much torque..." The wrench
was horribly out of standards.
</p>

<p>
For me, when it comes to a critical measuring device like a torque wrench,
now it has to be a trusted brand name.
</p>

<p>
Craftsman, ATD, S-K, Snap-On, Matco, Utica-Bonney, MAC, Proto (purchased
by Stanley), CDI and so on. Tool makers with a long history of producing
good tools. They cost more. They are worth it.
</p>

<p>
$140 - Stanley Proto J6006C 3/8-Inch Drive Ratcheting Head Micrometer Torque Wrench, 16-80-Feet Pound
</p>

<p>
I didn't want to make this so much a torque wrench discussion, but it
is relevant to changing ATF. Once that drain bolt is out and you're
ready to refill ATF, you have to re-install it to a proper torque
value. That allows it to stay put in leak-free fashion without wrecking
the transmission case. For me, torquing to just about 33 ft-lbs. with
a brand new crush washer has proved to be fine; the drain bolt always
stays put and does not leak between servicing events. I know it's less
than 36 ft-lbs., but it has worked. Again, I am using a new crush washer
every time. I don't have any experience of slightly under-torquing the
drain bolt with a used crush washer.

<p>
Use Honda DW-1 or Valvoline MaxLife Dex/Merc or another compatible
synthetic atf. Do NOT use any Honda Z-1 atf (what Honda specified for
your yr Ody) even if someone gives it to you.
</p>

<p>
I bought a long stemmed black plastic funnel at WalMart (I think Home
Depot has the same one even cheaper) for around $2 and it fit tightly
'over' the dip stick tube.
</p>

<p>
PS: If your atf is pretty dark on the dipstick, I would recommend at
least two drain and fills with driving in between.  If you don't know
the last time it was changed and suspect it may have Honda Z-1 atf in it,
then I would strongly recommend that you do 4 drain and fills.

Honda Transmission Problem Root Cause and a Fix?  <a href="http://www.odyclub.com/forums/24-1999-2004-odyssey/52345-honda-transmission-problem-root-cause-fix.html" target="_blank">Odyclub thread</a>

</p>


<p>
Let me add this to WATT-MAN's post: If they had found a signs of an
overheated gear, you would have a received a new transmission that has
redesigned ATF routing within the valve body. I will also say that, if
a failure occurs since late 04, and you take your ODY to a Honda dealer,
they are supposed to give you this re-designed transmission (i.e. not the
2002 to early 2004 transmission with the external “oil jet”. This is
the reason why I (me personally) would never have anyone else replace
the tranny after it fails. When I get a re-built, I want it to be the
one with the re-designed valve body.
</p>

<p>
That being said, there have been members here who have had failures
of this transmission and have often had codes that indicate hydraulic
pressure problems and/or shift solenoid problems.
</p>

<p>
So, let me stand out on a limb here and connect the dots…..these
problems are again due to clogged feed tubes or other wise restricted
ATF flow through these same screens.
</p>

<p>
Again….what should you do? I offer the same recommendations as above.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
Periodic cleaning of the screens under the clutch pressure solenoid
valves. See this link for a few select pages from the Honda Shop
Manual. Keep in mind that the 5-speed has two different clutch pressure
solenoids. So there is another feed tube with a screen in it under valve
“c”. Here is a sample order from Bernardi Honda on the parts that
I plan to order for my 5-speed.
  </li>
  <li>
At a minimum, replace the OEM filter on the side of the tranny
housing. I’ve taken that a step further and installed a Magnefine
in-line filter on my return line to the transmission.
  </li>
  <li>
Install an auxiliary cooler to aid in removing more heat from your
ATF. Afterall, “undercooling” was the “issue” with this tranny
to begin with.
  </li>
</ol>

</p>

<p>
I think it's just a lack of cooling on a "potentially undersized" clutch pack...not a valve.
</p>

<p>
With regard to the second, I'd say that the best way to the get longevity out of the old girl is to do the following:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Keep your foot out of the fuel injectors. Don't tromp on it....drive it easy.</li>
  <li>replace the fluid regularly. I do a drain/fill 1-2 times a year.</li>
  <li>add an auxillary cooler</li>
  <li>add the magnefine</li>
</ol>

DW-1 ATF vs MaxLife <a href="http://www.amsoil.com/shop/by-product/transmission-fluid/automatic/signature-series-multi-vehicle-synthetic-automatic-transmission-fluid/" target="_blank">odyclub thread</a>

</p>

<p>
I changed out the Honda ATF-Z1 for Valvoline MaxLife Dex/Merc and
Lubegard Red. That 4th gear clutch slip vanished, shifts were firmer (a
better clutch friction FM in the MaxLife), and I ended up with less wear
material caught on the drain plug magnet with each subsequent ATF change.
</p>

<p>
I used Valvoline MaxLife for 40,000+ miles, and it had a great
price. Inexplicably, Wal-Mart stopped carrying it one day. herrhaus helped
me out with an AmSOil Universal ATF purchase, and I started using that,
and have been using it for years, now.

Is it still pretty split between AmSOil, Valvoline MaxLife Dex/Merc,
Mobil 1, and Red Line ATF D4 or is one really preferred & why? Years
