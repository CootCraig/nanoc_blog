<p>
Use Honda DW-1 or Valvoline MaxLife Dex/Merc or another compatible
synthetic atf. Do NOT use any Honda Z-1 atf (what Honda specified for
your yr Ody) even if someone gives it to you.
</p>

<p>
I bought a long stemmed black plastic funnel at WalMart (I think Home
Depot has the same one even cheaper) for around $2 and it fit tightly
'over' the dip stick tube.
</p>

<p>
PS: If your atf is pretty dark on the dipstick, I would recommend at
least two drain and fills with driving in between.  If you don't know
the last time it was changed and suspect it may have Honda Z-1 atf in it,
then I would strongly recommend that you do 4 drain and fills.
