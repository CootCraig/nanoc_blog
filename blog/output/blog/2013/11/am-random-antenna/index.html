            <p>use one side of some twisted 300 ohm ribbon as the down lead into the
            house and to the tuner, connect that side to the AM post and t’other to
            the gnd post.</p>
            
            <p>then report back. the 1500 IIRC has a decent AM stage.</p>
            
            <p>And one other thing, IF it did originally came with a very small loop,
            then you may NEED one connected to make the longish random work! OFTEN
            stated in the manual and true IME</p>
            
            <p>most audio repair shope should have a few Small AM loops lying about.</p>

            <p>A random wire (with a good ground) tuned - by a cap and a tapped coil -
            to each station - or broadly tuned to cover the ones you want (like mine
            is) will be a good deal better than just a good ground.</p>
            
            <p>MUCH quieter as the AM stage’s own AGC will cope with the higher input.</p>

            <p>Below is the circuit diagram for my preferred choice of a T type circuit
            which includes a variable attenuator and which could not be simpler to
            construct.  This circuit, with the coil described, covers from 500kHz
            medium wave to 30MHz short wave.  Tuning capacitor VC1 is adjusted to
            match the aerial side while tuning capacitor VC2 is adjusted to match
            the receiver side.  This circuit is often referred to as a TRANSMATCH,
            particularly in the USA.</p>

            <p>As the surplus for 365pf caps has dried up, these little beauties were getting harder and harder to find. Not anymore! The Society now has a plentiful supply; we have them manufactured. They are brand new caps, 31 blade, .010-air-gap, 1/4” tuning shaft, and CW rotation decreases capacitance. Testing indicates a capacity range of 390 (fully meshed) to 16 pf (fully open). Shaft accommodates the point knob shown (sold separately), and a reduction drive for slower tuning (also sold separately).</p>

            <p>This AM Band Tuner will work with most any crystal radio set. Tuners are
            attached to the antenna and inductively couple the signal captured into
            your crystal radio set. By adding the tuner to your station, selectivity
            and volume can generally be improved.</p>
            
            <p>The backside of the tuner is shown at right. A dual-gang 365 pf capacitor
            is used to resonate the tuner coil and the antenna system as a whole. The
            result is an increase in the signal gleaned from the antenna and coupled
            to the set magnetically. The tuner uses a 6 by 5 inch front panel and
            a 6 by 8 in chassis. Two switches are used to configure the tuner. In
            addition, a nylon shaft is added to the tuning capacitor to reduce “hand
            capacity” while tuning. Kit time is less than one hour experienced
            builder and should add performance to your crystal radio station.</p>
