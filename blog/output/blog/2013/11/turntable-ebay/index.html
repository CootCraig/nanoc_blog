            <p>Up for sale, is an excellent condition, one owner, automatic Technics
            SL 1600 Direct Drive System Turntable, with very low hours, that I’ve
            purchased when it was brand new.</p>
            
            <p>It is nearly pristine cosmetically. Dust cover has couple scratches
            (see pictures).</p>
            
            <p>No cracks, or chips anywhere on dust cover, or on the TT, hinges work
            as new, nice and snug.</p>
            
            <p>Tone arm starts and returns to the correct point of record every time,
            and all functions work perfectly, as they should.</p>
            
            <p>Turntable comes with Audio Tech. Stereo Cartridge AT96E</p>
            
            <p>This SL 1600 has audiophile level performance, sounds amazing, it is
            a heavy and sturdy turntable, has superior accuracy, warm clean sound,
            and all in perfect working condition.</p>

            <p>Up for sale this week is this RARE vintage Technics SL 1600 Mark 2 Quartz
            Direct drive automatic turntable.  It comes with an original V15 type
            III Super Track Plus Sure Cartridge.</p>
            
            <p>Faint, barely visible scuffs on the dust cover. The base of the turntable
            is scuff free and very clean.</p>
            
            <p>The turntable works, I have used it to play my vinyls but the queue
            button, the pop-up light and the start stop button does not work
            either. The green quartz lock light does not come on but keeps perfect
            RPM.</p>

            <p>I almost bought another 1200 awhile back but went for the 1600 MK2</p>

            <p>…Don’t get me wrong, I love the 1200—it’s a ‘fun’ table—but the 1600
            MK2 is a ‘different animal’ or flavor in the best way possible. The 1600
            MK2 to me sonically represents why I thoroughly enjoy playing records;
            The music sounds very much alive on one of these decks!</p>
            
            <p>It’s a turntable and an investment you will not regret—but, if you
            opt not to go with the 1600 MK2, keep your eye open for these solidly
            built,reliable models that are just a few steps beneath the hierarchy
            of the 1600 MK2 and the 1200 MK2—–Technics SL Q2, SL Q3, SL Q202,
            SL Q 303.—I own two of these models and am very happy with them and
            ZERO mechanical or electronic issues with them.None whatsoever, and they
            are circa 1980-81.</p>
