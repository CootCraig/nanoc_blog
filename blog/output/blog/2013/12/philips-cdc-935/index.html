            <p>$149 box 1/2 kit</p>
            
            <p>The Piccolo is an active moving coil pre-preamplifier designed to step-up
            the cartridge signal from MC to MM levels. Adjustable loading and gain
            offers optimization for any MC cartridge. The discrete JFET circuit
            offers super-quiet and distortion-free operation. Compatible with any
            MM phonostage.</p>
            
            <p>Power is provided by either 4 internal AA batteries or a 120Vac
            external supply. The circuit employs super low-noise matched JFETs in a
            differential configuration, but tapping only the non-inverting leg for
            the output buffer, which can drive long cable runs. Careful attention
            to layout and wiring eliminate ground loop problems.</p>
            
            <p>The Piccolo is offered as a “box/2”, which is not a full kit, but includes
            a blank PCB with the JFETs already soldered in place, the metal blue
            case (silkscreened), and a few assorted hardware pieces. Basically,
            it is a half-kit plus box. This makes assembly very easy for DIYers.</p>

            <p>This kit contains all components required to electrically assemble
            a rechargeable cMoyBB v2.03R: all standard resistors, capacitors,
            jacks, connectors, ICs, and circuit board. No battery, knob, or
            enclosure. Soldering required.</p>
            
            <p>The cMoyBB makes a great first time soldering project. This kit contains
            all default components necessary to build the rechargeable cMoyBB v2.03R.</p>
