            <p>A friend is selling his 2002 Chevrolet 1500 extended cab 4x4.
            Itâ€™s in great condition and I would like to use it with a
            slide in camper eventually.  It comes with a matching truck
            cap that will get me started using it for off-pavement camping.</p>
            
            <p>My desired uses are.</p>
            
            <p>Mild weather (above freezing) on public land off-pavement roads.</p>
            
            <p>Winter camping near ski areas. 
            * Desire good insulation and furnace.
            * Prefer portable drinking water and grey water containers over
              winterized tanks.</p>
            
            <p>Stealth camping in urban setting to visit family and friends.
            * My thinking is hard sides and no obvious indicators of people
              inside will minimize hassles.</p>
            
            <p>Given the short bed and the relatively low weight capacity of
            the Chevy 1500 my thought is one of these models: Importer,
            Acapulco or Bayou.</p>
            
            <p>Looking over this forum, I think the plans can adapted to fit
            this truck and my intended uses.  I will do some looking at used
            campers to look for one that has suitable price/condition/features
            for me.</p>
            
            <p>I welcome comments from the forum.</p>
            
            <p>Thanks,
            Craig</p>
