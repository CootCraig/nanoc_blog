            <h3 id="dan-pickett-co-founder-at-launch-academy">Dan Pickett, Co-Founder at Launch Academy</h3>
            
            <p>We recommend to our students at Launch Academy (www.launchacademy.com) that they produce something they’re passionate about. </p>
            
            <p>For some, it’s a nagging problem that they’ve wanted to solve for
            themselves. Examples from our current cohort include a distraction
            tracking application and a a responsively designed flash card app that
            helps you study, For others, it’s around a hobby or something that came
            up among friends. Someone in our current class is building a restroom
            finder app for their sister because of a particularly challenging time
            they had in Maine one weekend :-). For many others, apps originate as
            startup ideas or to satiate a need they had at their previous job. One
            student is building a really cool app that puts patients on a stand by
            list for doctors if there are cancellations.</p>
            
            <p>The common denominator in all of the projects is that there is a story to
            tell where they’ve found a pain and built an application as a means to
            heal it. We find it creates a great dialog during the interview process
            that way.</p>
            
            <p>Our students (Launchers) get particularly hung up if the idea has already been done. Remember the goal: it’s to showcase your coding abilities. Don’t get it confused with building an MVP that you can raise funding for. It doesn’t have to be a revolutionary idea - it just has to provide a challenging opportunity for you to show what you can do.</p>
            
            <p>We call it a “breakable toy” because we aim for it to show a path of
            development and improvement. Having an interest in the domain is critical,
            because it encourages you to keep surmounting the technical challenges.</p>
            
            <h3 id="we-recommend-the-following-technical-components-be-included">We recommend the following technical components be included:</h3>
            
            <ul>
              <li>An ER diagram demonstrating an interesting or compelling data model</li>
              <li>API integration of some kind (can content be syndicated to facebook or twitter? Is there an interesting source of data you can tie in with?)</li>
              <li>Authentication and authorization</li>
              <li>Use of well tested service objects or Plain Old Ruby Objects (POROs) to demonstrate an understanding of ruby fundamentals</li>
              <li>Integration of some interesting third party code like state_machine, simple_form, or JQuery plugins for an appropriate reason</li>
              <li>A responsive or mobile-first design</li>
              <li>Some JavaScript that interacts with a JSON endpoint via AJAX (ideally with unit tests)</li>
              <li>A rich commit history that shows the evolution of the application and your learnings as a developer. Refactor commits are great for this type of thing!</li>
