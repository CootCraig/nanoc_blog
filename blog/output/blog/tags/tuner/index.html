            <h1 id="ccradio-ep-amfm-portable---a-bob-grove-whats-new-review">CCRadio-EP AM/FM Portable - A Bob Grove What’s New Review</h1>
            
            <p>Larry Van Horn, New Products Editor</p>
            
            <p>While it may seem strange that we would
            be reviewing anything as plebian as an AM/FM
            portable radio, there is a method to our madness.
            For several years, GE offered their “Superadio”
            to the consumer market; it had good sound, sharp
            AM selectivity, and external antenna connections.
            The radio sold in the $50-$60 range, and was
            very popular with domestic AM broadcast DX-
            ers. When it was discontinued, we had a surge of
            inquiries for a replacement, but none was to be
            found. Will the new CCRadio-EP be the answer?</p>
            
            <p>The radio has decent sound, good AM selec-
            tivity, wide/narrow FM selectivity, and external
            antenna connectors. It has the traditional, analog,
            slide-rule tuning dial which may be backlit for
            night viewing.</p>
            
            <p>Its 4-inch, self-contained speaker delivers
            room-filling sound with notable bass and clean
            highs with minimal distortion. Separate bass and
            treble controls invite custom high/low roll-offs to
            suit the listener’s preference. If you have a set of
            stereo headphones, a stereo output jack provides
            that listening mode as well. There is also a line-in
            jack in case you have a personal MP3 or other
            player that you’d like to hear through a larger
            speaker.</p>
            
            <p>The radio runs on either four D cells (not
            included) or a 120 VAC/6 VDC wall adapter
            (included). A snap-up/snap-down carrying handle
            facilitates transport.</p>
            
            <p>The CCRadio-EP is simple to operate and
            should appeal to techie types with its unique
            “Twin Coil Ferrite” AM fine tuning knob. This is
            an RF peaking adjustment for the antenna input,
            depending on the frequency being received. It
            works with both the internal and external antenna.</p>
            
            <p>It appears that the choice of external an-
            tenna is rather critical, and experimenting with
            optimum length and placement may be necessary
            to avoid “swamping” that tuning circuit, as well
            as avoiding common mode (ground loop) hum. I
            suspect that a shorter outdoor wire antenna would
            be better than a long one.</p>
            
            <p>The internal ferrite loop antenna remains
            in service with the external antenna attached. If
            you were experiencing electrical noise interfer-
            ence, it will still be there, hopefully attenuated
            somewhat by stronger signal strengths brought
            in by the outdoor wire. It is advisable to attach a
            ground wire to that respective terminal as well to
            avoid AC hum and other electrical line noise. If
            such interference persists, battery operation and/
            or relocation of the radio are recommended.</p>
            
            <p>An FM internal/external switch allows
            selection of an outdoor antenna via a TV-style F
            connector. The benefits and disadvantages of high
            sensitivity become immediately apparent when
            switching between antennas. With the radio’s
            telescoping whip, distances of up to 100 miles
            are readily received at my location; switching to
            an external beam, strong signal overload clouds
            reception of weaker signals.</p>
            
            <p>The AM wide/narrow IF filter selection
            is appropriately labeled “Music” and”Voice.”
            The wide bandpass allows more highs for in-
            creased music fidelity, while the low bandpass
            restricts the bandwidth to reject the frequencies
            not required for speech reception. Additionally,
            the independent bass and treble controls have a
            profound effect on emphasizing or attenuating
            the high and low audio frequencies.</p>
            
            <p>The accuracy of the printed frequency dial
            on our particular sample was excellent for FM,
            but rather arbitrary for AM. Of course with any
            analog-dial AM/FM radio, you tune for best
            reception, not for what the print on the dial says.</p>
            
            <p>The CCrane Radio-EP has good sensitivity
            and the 4-inch speaker delivers credible sound,
            enhanced by the separate treble and bass controls.
            Its AM selectivity switch is very effective for
            reducing adjacent channel interference. FM sen-
            sitivity is excellent, providing distant reception
            through its telescoping antenna.</p>
            
            <p>With so many off-the-shelf AM/FM radios
            now readily available from chain stores and at
            widely disparate prices, it’s hard to compare them
            fairly. Taking the radio at its face value – an AM/
            FM portable with good sound and sensitivity – the
            CCrane Radio-EP does its job well.</p>

            <p>If there is a Michael’s craft store in your area pick up some #6 bead
            stringing cord it makes a perfect dial cord replacement.</p>

            <p>when I get the stringing diagram and get it all together I’ll let
            ywall know the results.  It’s not just ‘hobbyshop’ string. It’s used
            for stringing beads and is VERY strong and I’m sure will work great. I
            may beezwax it first to be sure it’s ‘stiky’ around the tunning shaft
            and pullys just so’s it won’t slip..</p>

            <p>the 1st bead string didn’t work out too well so got some more, waxed and
            abit thicker from a craft store, after hitting an old electronics parts
            store that no longer gets dial cord, the GC brand. The waxed stuff was
            easier to work with and I got it all strung and it works fine.</p>
