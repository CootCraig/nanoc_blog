            <p>You do NOT need to further dampen the table. The table is waaaay over
            damped for use in clubs etc…</p>
            
            <p>All you upgrade ideas are great except the isoplatmat and the stock
            feet. Get rid of the matt all together and use Olly’s cork/foam spot
            matts. Contact him via the website. He just gives them away, and as
            far as I can tell, really enjoys doing so. Just drop him a line with
            your address.</p>
            
            <p>Second - get rid of the stock feet. Got to madisound and get some feet
            spikes. It’ll cost you less than $20. Make sure you get the right thread
            though. I think most use 6mm but mine is 1/4 20. go figure.  Those two
            improvements alone will blow you away. I say forget trying to replace the
            tonearm, just rewire the stock one. This is the biggest single upgrade
            you can make in my opinion.</p>

            <p>The auxiliary counterweight is cheap ($7) and available from KAB.</p>
            
            <p>I stuck a fender washer to my stock counterweight to get me going in the
            heat of the moment but installed the auxiliary weight about a week later
            when my order from KAB came in. Using the Technics auxiliary counterweight
            allows you to continue to use the Technics tone arm’s tracking force
            markings (which turn out to be surprisingly accurate in my experience).</p>
            
            <p>The Sumiko HS-12 adds about 7 grams of mass over the stock Technics
            headshell and works great with the DL-103 on the Technics arm. Much
            better than using the stock Technics headshell! Save that stock one for
            running a MM cartridge.</p>
            
            <p>Having interchangeable headshells and several spare cartridges all
            aligned and waiting is quite nice actually. I have three cartridges
            ready to play on my SL-1200 MkII, a Shure M97xE, an AT 140LC and the
            Denon DL-103 in a Sumiko HS-12 headshell.</p>
            
            <p>It takes like five minutes to swap out a headshell and reset the tracking
            force, anti-skate and vertical tracking angle (I have the settings
            written down for each so my feeble mind can remember the optimal settings
            for each).</p>
            
            <h2 id="what">what</h2>
            
            <p>The Denon DL103R is a low-output moving coil type cartridge. It has
            .27mv output and an internal impedance of 14 ohms. The weight is 8.5
            grams. It tracks at 2.4 - 2.8 grams. It has a spherical stylus with a
            surface hardness orientation toward the contact surfaces. The cantilever
            is double walled aluminum. The coils are wound of 99.9999%(6N) oxygen
            free copper. Compliance is 5 cu.</p>

            <p>I never heard my SL-1200 Mk2 without the Cardas rewire because I bought it from KAB with the mods already installed. I did however listen briefly without damping fluid in the KAB tonearm damper and when I added the fluid bass became tighter and clarity improved. Now, Kevin at KAB feels the Cardas rewire is the most significant upgrade ― I don’t know. I have always felt tonearm damping to be very important, too.</p>
            
            <p>My SL-1200 is connected to a Bob’s Devices 1131 SUT into a Yaqin MS-22B phono stage and I am very impressed with the Yaqin tube phono stage. I don’t know that it would be any better sounding than your Cambridge 640P, but it’s the first inexpensive phono stage that I find enjoyable and very listenable.</p>
            
            <p>Good luck,

            <p>I use a clothing lint brush, the kind you can get for a couple of bucks at just about any drug store: paddle shaped, fabric pad, plastic handle. The dye on the red ones can run if you use an cleaner with alcohol in it. If that’s a problem for you, look for a different color. I found a gray one at a Japanese “dollar” store for $1.50. Works perfectly.</p>

            <p>For the past several years I’ve been using the cleaning brushes offered by disc Doctor. I also use their cleaning solutions, fwiw. And I have learned to make efficient use of these.
            The Disc Doctor brushes have been copied by other companies. The Mo-Fi brush would be one example. And there may have been some litigation over that particular issue. Mo-Fi and Disc Doctor.</p>
            
            <p>In any case, what makes the Disc Doctor brushes really work is the shape of the frame that holds the brush fabric. The fabric appears to be a dense velvet material. The frame is an extruded piece of hard rubber. When you buy a pair of brushes from Disc Doctor it will come with some extra velvet pads. These have a self adhesive backing. Any problem with the fabric, remove it and install a new piece.</p>
            
            <p>The reason for two brushes is simple. One for detergent. The other for rinse. don’t mix these or you contaminate your rinse with more detergent. common sense alert. </p>
            
            <p>Scrub with detergent and brush</p>
            
            <p>Followed by a tap water rinse (how I use it) Yes, use running water to rinse the detergent from the record. Don’t soak the label while you’re at it.</p>
            
            <p>The second brush / distilled water, (rinse). The process is to spread distilled water over the record, then sponge it up with the “rinse brush”. The distilled water is an important part of the process. It removes whatever impurities were left over from the tap water rinse.</p>
            
            <p>And this would be my “kitchen sink method”. Although I haven’t yet mentioned that I use a spare turntable platter, with its rubber platter mat, placed on the kitchen counter top next to the sink. this is an important fixture for the process.</p>
            
            <p>To buy the disc doctor brushes; these can be found at many audio retailers that sell his products, or you can buy directly from disc doctor. See link below.</p>

            <p>…Don’t get me wrong, I love the 1200—it’s a ‘fun’ table—but the 1600
            MK2 is a ‘different animal’ or flavor in the best way possible. The 1600
            MK2 to me sonically represents why I thoroughly enjoy playing records;
            The music sounds very much alive on one of these decks!</p>
            
            <p>It’s a turntable and an investment you will not regret—but, if you
            opt not to go with the 1600 MK2, keep your eye open for these solidly
            built,reliable models that are just a few steps beneath the hierarchy
            of the 1600 MK2 and the 1200 MK2—–Technics SL Q2, SL Q3, SL Q202,
            SL Q 303.—I own two of these models and am very happy with them and
            ZERO mechanical or electronic issues with them.None whatsoever, and they
            are circa 1980-81.</p>

            <p>Yes, the arms in the MKIIs are similar. Plus, IIRC, it has a suspended
            subchasis holding the platter and arm. My SL-1600 MKII had this, too,
            and it was on a par, performance wise, with my SL-1200 MK2.  There is
            a source for the small belt that operates the cueing system. Try
            www.electronicplus.com. The part number is 1407-52, and the cost as of

            <p>The 1700 MK2 is the semi-auto model of the 1600 MK2 that I have…, posted on July 20, 2011 at 18:11:02</p>
            
            <p>matt67bianco</p>
            
            <p>Location: Phoenix, AZ</p>
            
            <p>Except the 1600 MK2 is a full-auto/start-stop ‘table, but can be used
            as a semi-auto, as well.</p>
            
            <p>The 1700 MK 2 has:</p>
            
            <p>A servo-motorized arm using a belt(independent from any
            linkages,gears,etc. connected to the platter motor). You manually cue it
            up but the arm will return by itself at the end of play to the resting
            position(hence, semi-auto).</p>
            
            <p>The top plinth is die-cast aluminum(no plastic).Double suspension
            system/isolators/shocks/springs.Inner base is TNRC material(Technics
            Non Resonance Compound,rubber, like the 1200 MK2).</p>
            
            <p>The motor(even specs),platter,mat,arm(sans auto feature) are exactly
            the same as the 1200.It’s a brushless DC,Quartz speed controlled motor
            for better(more accurate) pitch,wow &amp; flutter specs than if it was just
            a regular servo motor used on their lower end models.</p>
            
            <p>Now, this is what I found out about the differences between the playback
            sound characteristics and anti-resonant plinth damping qualities between
            the 1600 MK2/1700 MK2 versus the 1200 MK2.— I currently own a 1200
            MK2 and a 1600 MK2 for several years,now( I actually had a 1200 M3D(MK2)
            model,but, sold it years ago and just a month ago bought a 1200 MK2)…
            Don’t be fooled by the 1700 MK2 weighing less than the 1200 MK2. Its
            iso-sprung suspension does the job that it is intended to do—and VERY
            well indeed, I might add;Keeps any external unwanted vibrations from
            speakers,footfalls,etc. isolated or at bay.</p>
            
            <p>While the 1200 is heftier than the 1700/1600 MK2, if you finger tap
            test the top plinth on the 1200, you can still hear a light ‘thud’
            out the speakers(though,compared to lighter tables I’ve owned, it’s
            still obviously well damped). Finger tap the top of a 1700/1600MK2 and
            nothing!No ‘thud’ sound. Nada. I was really impressed and taken aback by
            how well the 1700/1600 MK2 were well made back in the day and outperformed
            a 1200 MK2 in that respect!</p>
            
            <p>Sound and music-wise,the stock 1200 MK2 does come across very pleasing
            and GOOD to these ears(my ears, my experience). Yes, it does have what
            some call a somewhat “dark” or slightly heavy sonic characteristic and
            presentation with the music—the louder you crank your system it becomes
            more evident(the TNRC plinth doing its job).</p>
            
            <p>In contrast, the 1700 MK2/1600 MK2 does NOT have this same sonic or
            musical playback characteristic. Music comes across as more lively. The
            louder I crank my system, I detect no “heavy solid” sound as I do with
            the 1200. There is something to be said for some suspended turntable
            plinths when that design is executed very well(Technics definitely knew
            what they were doing with the 1600 and 1700 MK2’s).</p>
            
            <p>Going from your SL D2 to the 1700 MK2 is night and day—I had an SL
            D2,also.What you have to look out for is the tonearm belt needing to be
            replaced(as the automated servo arm cueing belts are known to malfunction
            from age). On the 1700 MK2, you do not have a cueing mechanical arm
            lever like on the 1200, only a button on the front control bezel; It’s
            done with the arm servo belt motor.If the belt goes, you have no arm
            lifting or lowering function.</p>
            
            <p>I can tell you that others I’ve talked to over the years who own the 1700
            MK2 and 1600 MK2(including myself)absolutely enjoy what these particular
            Technics models can do; Both automatically and sonically!!They were the
            sleeper cousins to the 1200 MK2.Also, when these vintage ‘tables are
            modified,tweaked,customized,the results take them to a whole ‘nother
            level of great performance. Over the years, I’ve heard more comments
            about the(stock) 1200 not being musical enough, or detailed,or well imaged
            versus what I’ve heard and experienced with the other MK2 models.The 1200
            MK2 and 1700MK2,despite sharing a lot in common, except for suspension
            design and automation, are two different flavors IMHO and experience;
            One’s vanilla and one’s chocolate—I like both.</p>
            
            <p>(Btw, VA inmate, Scott Thompson—and I am ever so grateful to the
            man—introduced me to what the 1600 MK2 is capable of doing as I own
            one of his 1600 MK2 models).</p>
            
            <p>I hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Technics SL Q2(Quartz speed accurate,heavy,well damped die-cast metal
            plinth)—Simple,reliable,easy to use, semi-auto return(manual start u</p>
            
            <p>A couple of SL Q3’s (Full auto, Quartz speed accuracy,memo-repeat, can
            be used as a semi-manual by cueing tonearm yourself instead of letting
            autofunction take over)…</p>
            
            <p>Q2 is semi-auto (arm returns at end of play), BUT you can still use as
            partial manual since you have to cue it up yourself…The SL Q3 is the
            one I have (I have two of them)…I know you said full manual.However,
            again, you can maually cue up the tonearm if you want, overriding the
            auto-start… Very solid and underrated decks from Technics…They do
            have some of the 1200 heritage in them—The motor may not be as torquey
            as the 1200’s but same direct drive AND Quartz speed accurate design…
            My Q3’s are from 1979 and they still are FULLY operational in 2009(30
            year old ‘tables !)—NEVER has the full auto mechanism posed a problem
            or breakdown…The die-cast metal plinth itself is heavy (not as heavy
            as the 1200’s) and very well damped from unwanted vibrations…It’s
            practically a plug n’ play……..The Q2 is also a VERY simple and
            straightforward deck to use.For EASY and extremely low maintenance,
            I add 1 or 2 drops of spindle bearing oil every year or couple of years.</p>
            
            <p>What the Q2/Q3 lack are pitch control(cannot override or play with the
            quartz accurate function)and no adjustable tonearm VTA height adjustment
            as on the 1200 MK2.—So, if you are looking for those features, these
            Technics don’t have them.</p>
            
            <p>The Q2/3 are very reliable and economical solid turntables.—Super
            smooth damped cueing as well.Soundwise,they are also clean sounding
            decks(clean presentable bass,mids,highs,decent detail).I have also NEVER
            modded,tweaked,repaired, or have done anything to these fine underrated
            decks—Again, I do stress their great and super dependable reliability
            factor from my experience of owning them for years;They are no-nonsense
            decks that perform admirably…</p>
            
            <p>The Q2 and Q3 are like the ‘younger’ or smaller siblings of the 1200
            MK2 and 1600 MK2 (bear a closer resemblance to the 1600 MK2)…</p>

            <p>…get rid of that Technics SL Q2—-I have two Q3’s that have a few more
            automated features than the Q2…Both the Q2 and Q3 are VERY reliable
            and sharp looking decks as I’m sure you know already.I’m a fan of those
            ‘tables.My SL Q3’s have been performing flawlessy since 1979-(30 years
            and going strong).I just apply a drop or two of spindle bearing oil once
            a year.According to the Vintage Technics site, the Q2 was $200 with the
            Q3 at $240(MSRP prices).</p>

            was essentially the base, motor and platter of the 50 series, but with
            a plain-Jane S-shaped arm …rather than the arm of the 52F with its
            electronic resonance control. I worked in a hi-fi shop at the time and
            it was very hard to sell the 52F if folks listened to the 30L. The 30L
            was less expensive and better sounding.</p>

            <p>I hardly ever see a good 70’s TT anymore in the thrifts. Online there
            is less supply and the prices have gone up. Sellers want 200 euro for a
            Thorens TD160 with the heavy arm. There are still vintage TT’s flying
            under the radar so to speak, Akai AP 206/207, Philips 800 series,
            Pioneer Pl-12D, Technics SQ DD, Dual 500 series.</p>

            <p>I’ve been trying to help a poster on the Record Collectors Guild Forum
            who is trying to get into vinyl for dirt cheap. My thought is that there
            are probably quite a number of people out there for whom the $400+ for
            a decent new turntable is really a huge amount of money. Maybe we ought
            to combine our expertise to put together a buyers guide to inexpensive
            used turntables: which ones are worth looking for and which ones to avoid
            plus notes on how to check for serious problems. I’m talking about tables
            that someone has a realistic chance of finding used in good condition
            for less than $200, ideally less than $100. There probably should be a
            parallel FAQ about cheap cartridges.</p>
            
            <p>My nomination: the Denon DP-30L II - this is a competitor for the Technics
            SL-1200 series but it has a lower mass arm (dynamically balanced/no servo)
            better suited to high compliance moving magnet or moving iron cartridges.</p>
            
            <p>I’ll let the Thorens, Technics and Dual experts fill in their nominations
            in those lines. JVC? Pioneer? Kenwood? Yamaha?</p>
            
            <p>I would avoid the Philips GA-212/312 series - in my experience the arm
            “bearings” (I think they may actually be delrin bushings) don’t age
            very gracefully.  IMO No P-Mounts!</p>

            <p>All used direct drive turntables mostly under $200 with integrated
            tonearm. Some might cost a little more but if you play your card right,
            you can still get them in the $200 range. In that range, I usually look
            for ones with a coreless motor for my personal sonic taste.</p>
