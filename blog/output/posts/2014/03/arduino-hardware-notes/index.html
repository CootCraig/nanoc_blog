        <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
        
        <p>The Pololu adjustable boost regulator is a very flexible switching
        regulator (also called a switched-mode power supply, SMPS, or DC-to-DC
        converter) that can generate voltages higher than its input voltage. We
        offer two adjustable ranges: approximately 2.5 V to 9.5 V and 4 V to 25
        V. The output voltage can be set using the trimmer potentiometer in the
        upper-right corner of the board. The input voltage range is 1.5 V to
        16 V (the input voltage should be kept below the output voltage). The
        integrated 2 A switch allows for output currents high enough to drive
        small motors, as in our 3pi robot, and allows large voltage gains,
        such as obtaining 24 V from two NiMH or NiCd cells.</p>

        <h3 id="connections">Connections</h3>
        
        <p>The boost regulator has just three connections: the input voltage, ground,
        and the output voltage. These three connections are labeled on the back
        side of the PCB, and they are arranged with a 0.1″ spacing along the
        edge of the board for compatibility with standard solderless breadboards
        and perfboards and connectors that use a 0.1″ grid. You can solder
        wires directly to the board or solder in either the 3×1 straight male
        header strip or the 3×1 right-angle male header strip that is included.</p>
        
        <h3 id="setting-the-output-voltage">Setting the output voltage</h3>
        
        <p>The output voltage can be adjusted using a meter and a light load
        (e.g. a 10 kΩ resistor). Turning the potentiometer clockwise increases
        the output voltage. The output voltage can be affected by a screwdriver
        touching the potentiometer, so the output measurement should be done
        with nothing touching the potentiometer.</p>

        <p>$4.95</p>
        
        <p>This compact (0.45″×0.6″) U1V11F5 switching step-up (or boost)
        voltage regulator efficiently generates 5 V from input voltages as low as
        0.5 V. Unlike most boost regulators, the U1V11F5 offers a true shutdown
        option that turns off power to the load, and it automatically switches
        to a linear down-regulation mode when the input voltage exceeds the
        output. The pins have a 0.1″ spacing, making this board compatible
        with standard solderless breadboards and perfboards.</p>
        
        <h3 id="overview-1">Overview</h3>
        
        <p>This 5 V boost (step-up) voltage regulator generates higher output
        voltages from input voltages as low as 0.5 V, and it also automatically
        switches to a linear down-regulation mode when the input voltage exceeds
        the output. This makes it great for powering 5 V electronics projects
        from 1 to 3 NiMH, NiCd, or alkaline cells or from a single lithium-ion
        cell. Additionally, unlike most boost regulators, this unit offers a
        true shutdown option that turns off power to the load (with typical
        boost regulators, the input voltage will pass directly through to the
        output when they are disabled).</p>
        
        <p>When boosting, this module acts as a switching regulator (also called
        switched-mode power supplies (SMPS) or DC-to-DC converters) and has a
        typical efficiency between 70% to 90%. The available output current is
        a function of the input voltage, output voltage, and efficiency (see
        Typical Efficiency and Output Current section below), but the input
        current can typically be as high as 1.2 A.</p>

          <li>Small size: 0.45″ × 0.6″; × 0.1″ (12 × 15 × 3 mm)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 id="connections-1">Connections</h3>
        
        <p>The boost regulator has four connections: shutdown (SHDN), input voltage
        (VIN), ground (GND), and output voltage (VOUT).</p>
        
        <p>The SHDN can be driven low (typically under 0.4 V) to power down the
        regulator and turn off power to the load (unlike most boost regulators,
        the input power does not pass through to the output when the board is
        disabled). This pin is internally pulled up to VIN through an 100 kΩ
        resistor, so it can be left disconnected or connected directly to VIN
        if you do not need to use the disable feature. The disable threshold is
        a function of the input voltage as follows:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>For VIN &lt; 0.8 V, SHDN voltage must be below 0.1×VIN to disable the regulator and above 0.9×VIN to enable it.</li>
          <li>For 0.8 V ≤ VIN ≤ 1.5 V, SHDN voltage must be below 0.2×VIN to disable the regulator and above 0.8×VIN to enable it.</li>
          <li>For VIN &gt; 1.5 V, SHDN voltage must be below 0.4 V to disable the regulator and above 1.2 V to enable it.</li>
          <li>The input voltage, VIN, must be at least 0.5 V for the regulator to turn on. However, once the regulator is on, the input voltage can drop as low as 0.3 V and the 5 V output voltage will be maintained on VOUT. Unlike standard boost regulators, this regulator has an additional linear down-regulation mode that allows it to convert input voltages as high as 5.5 V down to 5 V for small to moderate sized loads (for example, in our tests, the adjustable version of this regulator was able to supply 300 mA while converting an input of 5.5 V down to 1.8 V). When the input voltage exceeds 5 V, the regulator automatically switches to this down-regulation mode. The input voltage should not exceed 5.5 V. Please be wary of destructive LC spikes that might cause the input voltage to surpass 5.5 V (see below for more information).</li>
