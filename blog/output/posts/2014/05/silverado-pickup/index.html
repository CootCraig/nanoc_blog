    <p>A friend is selling his 2002 Chevrolet 1500 extended cab 4x4.
    Itâ€™s in great condition and I would like to use it with a
    slide in camper eventually.  It comes with a matching truck
    cap that will get me started using it for off-pavement camping.</p>
    
    <p>My desired uses are.</p>
    
    <p>Mild weather (above freezing) on public land off-pavement roads.</p>
    
    <p>Winter camping near ski areas. 
    * Desire good insulation and furnace.
    * Prefer portable drinking water and grey water containers over
      winterized tanks.</p>
    
    <p>Stealth camping in urban setting to visit family and friends.
    * My thinking is hard sides and no obvious indicators of people
      inside will minimize hassles.</p>
    
    <p>Given the short bed and the relatively low weight capacity of
    the Chevy 1500 my thought is one of these models: Importer,
    Acapulco or Bayou.</p>
    
    <p>Looking over this forum, I think the plans can adapted to fit
    this truck and my intended uses.  I will do some looking at used
    campers to look for one that has suitable price/condition/features
    for me.</p>
    
    <p>I welcome comments from the forum.</p>
    
    <p>Thanks,
    Craig</p>
