        <p>Frame and panel construction, also called rail and stile, is a woodworking
        technique often used in the making of doors, wainscoting, and other
        decorative features for cabinets, furniture, and homes. The basic idea
        is to capture a ‘floating’ panel within a sturdy frame, as opposed to
        techniques used in making a slab solid wood cabinet door or drawer front,
        the door is constructed of several solid wood pieces running in a vertical
        or horizontal direction [1] with exposed endgrains. Usually, the panel is
        not glued to the frame but is left to ‘float’ within it so that seasonal
        movement of the wood comprising the panel does not distort the frame.</p>
        
        <p>Frame and panel construction at its most basic consists of five members:
        the panel and the four members which make up the frame. The vertical
        members of the frame are called stiles while the horizontal members are
        known as rails. A basic frame and panel item consists of a top rail,
        a bottom rail, two stiles, and a panel. This is a common method of
        constructing cabinet doors and these are often referred to as a five
        piece door.</p>
        
        <p>In larger panels it is common to divide the panel into one or more
        sections. To house the extra panels, dividing pieces known as mid rails
        and mid stiles or muntins are added to the frame.</p>
