        <p>$149 box 1/2 kit</p>
        
        <p>The Piccolo is an active moving coil pre-preamplifier designed to step-up
        the cartridge signal from MC to MM levels. Adjustable loading and gain
        offers optimization for any MC cartridge. The discrete JFET circuit
        offers super-quiet and distortion-free operation. Compatible with any
        MM phonostage.</p>
        
        <p>Power is provided by either 4 internal AA batteries or a 120Vac
        external supply. The circuit employs super low-noise matched JFETs in a
        differential configuration, but tapping only the non-inverting leg for
        the output buffer, which can drive long cable runs. Careful attention
        to layout and wiring eliminate ground loop problems.</p>
        
        <p>The Piccolo is offered as a “box/2”, which is not a full kit, but includes
        a blank PCB with the JFETs already soldered in place, the metal blue
        case (silkscreened), and a few assorted hardware pieces. Basically,
        it is a half-kit plus box. This makes assembly very easy for DIYers.</p>
