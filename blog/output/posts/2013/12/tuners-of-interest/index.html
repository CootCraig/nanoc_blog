        <p>If you can drop about 4 dB (40 wpc), I’d recommend the vintage
        Harman/Kardon HK-930…….. One of the best FM tuners I’ve heard,
        receiver or separate.</p>
        
        <p>If you must have 100 wpc, I’d recommend either a used Onkyo TX-8500
        (not Mk II) or Sansui G-901 DB (not G-9000 DB).</p>

        <p>The Kenwood KT-880D is an inexpensive AM/FM tuner with remarkable
        performance. It is sensitive. It is one of the few tuners immune to HD
        Radio self-noise without modification. Distortion is extremely low, and
        unlike many tuners, doesn’t rise for weak signals. Finally, resistance
        to front-end overload rivals that of tuners with balanced mixers. The
        KT-880D uses simple, straightforward circuitry that works so well you
        wonder why designers ever bother with fancier circuits.</p>

        <p>Grundig S350DL has line outputs. When using them the FM output is in
        stereo. Also, the radio allows a double set of batteries to be installed
        so if one set dies, just flip the switch and you are good to go though
        the D cell battery life is excellent. It is decent enough that it makes
        for a good system tuner on a budget. I liked them enough to buy a pair.</p>

        <p>Rotel RT-990BX (1993, $750) search eBay The FM-only RT-990BX is almost
        as good as the very similar RHT10 at a much lower price, according to our
        panelist Bob (see Bob’s review of the RHT10 above). It is not as rare as
        the RHT10 and usually sells for $175-340 on eBay. It has a remote control,
        which is required to access the 16 presets, but Bob says the RT-990BX
        sounds so good that it is worth buying even without the remote. Other
        front-panel controls are stereo/mono switch, RF attenuator, wide/narrow
        bandwidth selector and signal-strength indicator. Our contributor David
        Rich notes that the RT-990BX has a double-tuned filter at the antenna and
        is double-tuned after the RF amp. Here’s Bob’s comparison of the RHT10
        and RT-990BX: “The RHT10 and RT-990BX are essentially the same tuner,
        with major cosmetic and minor parts and circuit differences. They
        use the same remote control codes, although again, the remotes are
        different in appearance. They also use the same circuit board and parts
        designations on the board, although the boards are different in color. The
        RT-990BX is missing parts in one area, where the stereo blend circuit is
        implemented. They have the same RF front end and sine wave type stereo
        MPX circuit. Alignment procedure is the same for both. Here is a list
        of functional differences I’ve compiled:</p>

        <p>Luxman T-117 - this is a fabulous tuner for the money (available only
        used of course as it was produced in the 80’s). I’ve owned a couple of
        MD-102s from Magnum Dynalab and the Luxman comes very close to the sound
        quality of these units, which retail for over 2k. I even prefer the
        Luxman to the Classe Tuner-1 (but did love having the remote control)
        except in the bass department, where the Classe seemed to excel even
        over the more expensive MD-102…</p>

        <p>Many FM stations are also transmitting HD FM in NYC that interfers with
        analog FM. You also need good selectivity. I recommend Kenwood KT-990D
        or Sansui TU-D99X that will reject the HD part of the signal due to the
        Multiplexer design. Both tuners are quite sensitive &amp; rated high for
        good sonics.</p>

        <p>Maybe a vintage tuner like a Kenwood KT-7500, when modified can provide
        some amazing selectivity. But of course, it’s the antenna that really
        brings home the bacon…if he doesn’t have a Yagi on a rotator, that’d
        be something to look in to. A big Yagi like an APS-14 does wonders for
        rejecting unwanted signals if the receiver’s front end is capable of
        dealing with the increased signal strength without overloading :)</p>

        <p>I know this will get some hoots but if you want selectivity try a car
        radio. They are not the most senstive but excel in selectivity. Other
        than that possilby the Grundig Satillit 800. Also, I have a Eton/Grundig
        S350DL that seem quite decent and I’ve not experienced any issues with
        adjacent channel selectivity. The 800 has been discontinued but they
        are available used for reasonable dollars and the S350DL seems to be
        withdrawn quite recently but new ones should be around.</p>
