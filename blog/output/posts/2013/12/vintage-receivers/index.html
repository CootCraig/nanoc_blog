        <p>McIntosh MAC4100 should do the trick and within your price range. Others:</p>
        
        <p>JVC JR-S501 120 watts with a tuner that does well. What you lose in the
        difference if price between it and the MAC4100 is the refinement of the
        Mc plus the build quality but, the cost difference may be worth it.</p>

        <p>Just scored this 70s vintage Akai AM-2200 stereo amp in a thrift. 15 euro grand total. 1 day warranty! So at home i immediately hooked it up. Lots of noise coming from the scratchy pots and switches but it worked on both channels. </p>
        
        <p>The next day, the usual routine. Removed the case. Blew out the dust. Sprayed contact cleaner in the pots and switches and turned and switched them many times. Clened the alu front and the “wooden” case. </p>
        
        <p>Always amazing how the sound cleans up after a bit of TLC. No hum. No scratchy pots anymore. Nice clean clear sound on my Rotel CD player (15 euro) and KEF Chorale III speakers(10 euro). Then i hooked up my Thorens Td145mk2(5 euro, OK ex VdH rewire…)/Pickering XV15. Spinning an old James Taylor record. Wow what a sound, wide deep stereo image. </p>
        
        <p>Akai was a mainstream Japanese hifi brand back then, this was their BOTL stereo amp. This was affordable stuff. I see a big power trafo in there, big elco’s. Alu front, big metal case, wooden top. It screams quality. Now we stream MP3’s from our smartphones to our bluetooth boomboxes. I’m getting old and pessimistic…</p>

        <p>I have a Toshiba “super receiver” (SA-7100) that weighs about 60 pounds and boy does it put out the sound. Great stuff.</p>
