        <p>You do NOT need to further dampen the table. The table is waaaay over
        damped for use in clubs etc…</p>
        
        <p>All you upgrade ideas are great except the isoplatmat and the stock
        feet. Get rid of the matt all together and use Olly’s cork/foam spot
        matts. Contact him via the website. He just gives them away, and as
        far as I can tell, really enjoys doing so. Just drop him a line with
        your address.</p>
        
        <p>Second - get rid of the stock feet. Got to madisound and get some feet
        spikes. It’ll cost you less than $20. Make sure you get the right thread
        though. I think most use 6mm but mine is 1/4 20. go figure.  Those two
        improvements alone will blow you away. I say forget trying to replace the
        tonearm, just rewire the stock one. This is the biggest single upgrade
        you can make in my opinion.</p>

        <p>The auxiliary counterweight is cheap ($7) and available from KAB.</p>
        
        <p>I stuck a fender washer to my stock counterweight to get me going in the
        heat of the moment but installed the auxiliary weight about a week later
        when my order from KAB came in. Using the Technics auxiliary counterweight
        allows you to continue to use the Technics tone arm’s tracking force
        markings (which turn out to be surprisingly accurate in my experience).</p>
        
        <p>The Sumiko HS-12 adds about 7 grams of mass over the stock Technics
        headshell and works great with the DL-103 on the Technics arm. Much
        better than using the stock Technics headshell! Save that stock one for
        running a MM cartridge.</p>
        
        <p>Having interchangeable headshells and several spare cartridges all
        aligned and waiting is quite nice actually. I have three cartridges
        ready to play on my SL-1200 MkII, a Shure M97xE, an AT 140LC and the
        Denon DL-103 in a Sumiko HS-12 headshell.</p>
        
        <p>It takes like five minutes to swap out a headshell and reset the tracking
        force, anti-skate and vertical tracking angle (I have the settings
        written down for each so my feeble mind can remember the optimal settings
        for each).</p>
        
        <h2 id="what">what</h2>
        
        <p>The Denon DL103R is a low-output moving coil type cartridge. It has
        .27mv output and an internal impedance of 14 ohms. The weight is 8.5
        grams. It tracks at 2.4 - 2.8 grams. It has a spherical stylus with a
        surface hardness orientation toward the contact surfaces. The cantilever
        is double walled aluminum. The coils are wound of 99.9999%(6N) oxygen
        free copper. Compliance is 5 cu.</p>

        What attracted me to this phono preamp is the use of the LM4562 (an opamp I’ve been interested in for some time) and the very clever PSU to power everything. </p>

        <p>I never heard my SL-1200 Mk2 without the Cardas rewire because I bought it from KAB with the mods already installed. I did however listen briefly without damping fluid in the KAB tonearm damper and when I added the fluid bass became tighter and clarity improved. Now, Kevin at KAB feels the Cardas rewire is the most significant upgrade ― I don’t know. I have always felt tonearm damping to be very important, too.</p>
        
        <p>My SL-1200 is connected to a Bob’s Devices 1131 SUT into a Yaqin MS-22B phono stage and I am very impressed with the Yaqin tube phono stage. I don’t know that it would be any better sounding than your Cambridge 640P, but it’s the first inexpensive phono stage that I find enjoyable and very listenable.</p>
        
        <p>Good luck,
        John Elison</p>

        <p>I use a clothing lint brush, the kind you can get for a couple of bucks at just about any drug store: paddle shaped, fabric pad, plastic handle. The dye on the red ones can run if you use an cleaner with alcohol in it. If that’s a problem for you, look for a different color. I found a gray one at a Japanese “dollar” store for $1.50. Works perfectly.</p>

        <p>For the past several years I’ve been using the cleaning brushes offered by disc Doctor. I also use their cleaning solutions, fwiw. And I have learned to make efficient use of these.
        The Disc Doctor brushes have been copied by other companies. The Mo-Fi brush would be one example. And there may have been some litigation over that particular issue. Mo-Fi and Disc Doctor.</p>
        
        <p>In any case, what makes the Disc Doctor brushes really work is the shape of the frame that holds the brush fabric. The fabric appears to be a dense velvet material. The frame is an extruded piece of hard rubber. When you buy a pair of brushes from Disc Doctor it will come with some extra velvet pads. These have a self adhesive backing. Any problem with the fabric, remove it and install a new piece.</p>
        
        <p>The reason for two brushes is simple. One for detergent. The other for rinse. don’t mix these or you contaminate your rinse with more detergent. common sense alert. </p>
        
        <p>Scrub with detergent and brush</p>
        
        <p>Followed by a tap water rinse (how I use it) Yes, use running water to rinse the detergent from the record. Don’t soak the label while you’re at it.</p>
        
        <p>The second brush / distilled water, (rinse). The process is to spread distilled water over the record, then sponge it up with the “rinse brush”. The distilled water is an important part of the process. It removes whatever impurities were left over from the tap water rinse.</p>
        
        <p>And this would be my “kitchen sink method”. Although I haven’t yet mentioned that I use a spare turntable platter, with its rubber platter mat, placed on the kitchen counter top next to the sink. this is an important fixture for the process.</p>
        
        <p>To buy the disc doctor brushes; these can be found at many audio retailers that sell his products, or you can buy directly from disc doctor. See link below.</p>
