        <p>Larry Van Horn, New Products Editor</p>
        
        <p>While it may seem strange that we would
        be reviewing anything as plebian as an AM/FM
        portable radio, there is a method to our madness.
        For several years, GE offered their “Superadio”
        to the consumer market; it had good sound, sharp
        AM selectivity, and external antenna connections.
        The radio sold in the $50-$60 range, and was
        very popular with domestic AM broadcast DX-
        ers. When it was discontinued, we had a surge of
        inquiries for a replacement, but none was to be
        found. Will the new CCRadio-EP be the answer?</p>
        
        <p>The radio has decent sound, good AM selec-
        tivity, wide/narrow FM selectivity, and external
        antenna connectors. It has the traditional, analog,
        slide-rule tuning dial which may be backlit for
        night viewing.</p>
        
        <p>Its 4-inch, self-contained speaker delivers
        room-filling sound with notable bass and clean
        highs with minimal distortion. Separate bass and
        treble controls invite custom high/low roll-offs to
        suit the listener’s preference. If you have a set of
        stereo headphones, a stereo output jack provides
        that listening mode as well. There is also a line-in
        jack in case you have a personal MP3 or other
        player that you’d like to hear through a larger
        speaker.</p>
        
        <p>The radio runs on either four D cells (not
        included) or a 120 VAC/6 VDC wall adapter
        (included). A snap-up/snap-down carrying handle
        facilitates transport.</p>
        
        <p>The CCRadio-EP is simple to operate and
        should appeal to techie types with its unique
        “Twin Coil Ferrite” AM fine tuning knob. This is
        an RF peaking adjustment for the antenna input,
        depending on the frequency being received. It
        works with both the internal and external antenna.</p>
        
        <p>It appears that the choice of external an-
        tenna is rather critical, and experimenting with
        optimum length and placement may be necessary
        to avoid “swamping” that tuning circuit, as well
        as avoiding common mode (ground loop) hum. I
        suspect that a shorter outdoor wire antenna would
        be better than a long one.</p>
        
        <p>The internal ferrite loop antenna remains
        in service with the external antenna attached. If
        you were experiencing electrical noise interfer-
        ence, it will still be there, hopefully attenuated
        somewhat by stronger signal strengths brought
        in by the outdoor wire. It is advisable to attach a
        ground wire to that respective terminal as well to
        avoid AC hum and other electrical line noise. If
        such interference persists, battery operation and/
        or relocation of the radio are recommended.</p>
        
        <p>An FM internal/external switch allows
        selection of an outdoor antenna via a TV-style F
        connector. The benefits and disadvantages of high
        sensitivity become immediately apparent when
        switching between antennas. With the radio’s
        telescoping whip, distances of up to 100 miles
        are readily received at my location; switching to
        an external beam, strong signal overload clouds
        reception of weaker signals.</p>
        
        <p>The AM wide/narrow IF filter selection
        is appropriately labeled “Music” and”Voice.”
        The wide bandpass allows more highs for in-
        creased music fidelity, while the low bandpass
        restricts the bandwidth to reject the frequencies
        not required for speech reception. Additionally,
        the independent bass and treble controls have a
        profound effect on emphasizing or attenuating
        the high and low audio frequencies.</p>
        
        <p>The accuracy of the printed frequency dial
        on our particular sample was excellent for FM,
        but rather arbitrary for AM. Of course with any
        analog-dial AM/FM radio, you tune for best
        reception, not for what the print on the dial says.</p>
        
        <p>The CCrane Radio-EP has good sensitivity
        and the 4-inch speaker delivers credible sound,
        enhanced by the separate treble and bass controls.
        Its AM selectivity switch is very effective for
        reducing adjacent channel interference. FM sen-
        sitivity is excellent, providing distant reception
        through its telescoping antenna.</p>
        
        <p>With so many off-the-shelf AM/FM radios
        now readily available from chain stores and at
        widely disparate prices, it’s hard to compare them
        fairly. Taking the radio at its face value – an AM/
        FM portable with good sound and sensitivity – the
        CCrane Radio-EP does its job well.</p>
