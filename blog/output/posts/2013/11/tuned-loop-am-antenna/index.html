        <p>If you use a “Pi-Section Coupler”, your antenna can be as short as 30 feet
        or as long as 100 feet. The combination can be made to work efficiently
        at all frequencies between 500 and 6800 kHz.</p>

        <p>How can you vastly improve your Medium Wave reception? its quite simple
        really, all you need is 120 foot of wire, a few lengths of timber and
        an old tuning capacitor with which you can build the answer to every
        DX’ers prayers, a tuned loop antenna.</p>

        <p>The coupling from the antenna to the radio is through the ferrite loop
        antenna inside most portable AM radios. We have received several inquries
        about the possibility of conneting the antenna to a regular component
        receiver.  Although every situation is different, it is generally easy
        to do.</p>

        <p>The MTM Scientific AM Loop Antenna is quite a different animal from all
        of those however for a few reasons. First it is a large square wood frame
        loop measuring slightly over 17” per side which makes it at least twice
        the size of the other passive AM loops I mentioned. This seemed like an
        exciting prospect as it seemed likely it would be able to capture more
        signal than the smaller loops.</p>
        
        <h2 id="loop-antennashttpwwwfrontiernetnetjadaleloophtm"><a href="http://www.frontiernet.net/~jadale/Loop.htm">Loop Antennas</a></h2>
        
        <p>A loop antenna is a small multi turn loop of less than 1/10th wavelength
        in length. The loop is wound on a form, which may be either box
        (solenoid), or spiral (pancake) wound. The core material can either be
        air, or a powdered iron compound (Ferrite). The gain of a loop is much
        less than a longwire, but it has much less noise pickup. A properly
        designed Loop primarily responds to the magnetic component of the radio
        wave. Note that noise resides primarily in the electrical component. A
        vertical antenna responds mainly to the electrical component.</p>

        <p>I think the generalization about ‘how many feet’ is more of a ballpark
        consideration. If you’re using a typical BCB range tuning cap like
        365-400pf you’re going to fall into the 50-75 ft range almost inherently
        for most practical sizes and thats never been a bad thing.</p>
        
        <p>Now if you want to use something like 200 feet of wire (a la some of
        these wacky broomstick or liter-coke bottle ideas) and find a cap to
        tune it with you’ll immediately see the uh-oh at 1700 kcs. And the other
        extreme…20 feet of wire at 550kc.</p>
        
        <p>That said, you’ll run into the unavailability of standard parts and
        having to multi-bandswitch the thing to cover BCB probably before you
        will encounter the differences in actual peformance.</p>
        
        <p>If you are building a 2-3’ size loop with a typical BCB cap you can tune
        the entire range without tapping it. The difference in wire length should
        not be noticeable.</p>

        <p>I am proud to introduce you to my first loop tube radio. I had this
        in mind for a while and it took me a long time to get started. The
        radio design was simple, but how was I to make this into another show
        piece radio? Do I make it into a 1920’s look, or a rock n’ roll 50’s
        radio? This one is both. The design, and parts are something that you
        might have seen in a 1950’s Poptronics magazine. Then there are some
        hints that have that definite roaring 20’s look. The loop itself is an
        example as well as the art deco Garolite® front panel. The wood base
        gives this radio a breadboard look. I sure did it all. This puppy kept
        me up nights thinking how I was going to build her. I like that curve
        that decorates the front panel. I used a large pizza pan as a guide.</p>
        
        <p>The radio is a simple regenerative type using a 6418 subminiature
        tube. This is a pentode tube that has a 30 volt plate maximum rating. The
        filament runs on 1.25 volts at 10ma. With 18 volts on the plate and a
        low current filament, the batteries will last a long time.</p>
